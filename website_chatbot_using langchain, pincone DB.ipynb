Nvidia is also a leading supplier of artificial intelligence (AI) hardware and software.[6][7] Nvidia outsources the manufacturing of the hardware it designs.\\n\\nNvidia\\'s professional line of GPUs are used for edge-to-cloud computing and in supercomputers and workstations for applications in fields such as architecture, engineering and construction, media and entertainment, automotive, scientific research, and manufacturing design.[8] Its GeForce line of GPUs are aimed at the consumer market and are used in applications such as video editing, 3D rendering, and PC gaming. With a market share of 80.2% in the second quarter of 2023,[9] Nvidia leads global sales of discrete desktop GPUs by a wide margin. The company expanded its presence in the gaming industry with the introduction of the Shield Portable (a handheld game console), Shield Tablet (a gaming tablet), and Shield TV (a digital media player), as well as its cloud gaming service GeForce Now.[10]\\n\\nIn addition to GPU design and outsourcing manufacturing, Nvidia provides the CUDA software platform and API that allows the creation of massively parallel programs which utilize GPUs.[11][12] They are deployed in supercomputing sites around the world.[13][14] In the late 2000s, Nvidia had moved into the mobile computing market, where it produced Tegra mobile processors for smartphones and tablets and vehicle navigation and entertainment systems.[15][16][17] Its competitors include AMD, Intel,[18] Qualcomm,[19] and AI accelerator companies such as Cerebras and Graphcore. It also makes AI-powered software for audio and video processing (e.g., Nvidia Maxine).[20]\\n\\nNvidia\\'s attempt to acquire Arm from SoftBank in September 2020 failed to materialize following extended regulatory scrutiny, leading to the termination of the deal in February 2022 in what would have been the largest semiconductor acquisition.[21][22] In 2023, Nvidia became the seventh public U.S. company to be valued at over $1 trillion,[23] and the company\\'s valuation has increased rapidly since then amid growing demand for data center chips with AI capabilities in the midst of the AI boom.[24][25] In June 2024, for one day, Nvidia overtook Microsoft as the world\\'s most valuable publicly traded company, with a market capitalization of over $3.3 trillion.[26]\\n\\nHistory\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nFounding\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nNvidia was founded on April 5, 1993,[27][28][29] by Jensen Huang (who, as of 2025[update], remains CEO), a Taiwanese-American electrical engineer who was previously the director of CoreWare at LSI Logic and a microprocessor designer at AMD; Chris Malachowsky, an engineer who worked at Sun Microsystems; and Curtis Priem, who was previously a senior staff engineer and graphics chip designer at IBM and Sun Microsystems.[30][31] In late 1992, the three men agreed to start the company in a meeting at a Denny\\'s roadside diner on Berryessa Road in East San Jose.[32][33][34][35]\\n\\nAt the time, Malachowsky and Priem were frustrated with Sun\\'s management and were looking to leave, but Huang was on \"firmer ground\",[36] in that he was already running his own division at LSI.[33] The three co-founders discussed a vision of the future which was so compelling that Huang decided to leave LSI[36] and become the chief executive officer of their new startup.[33]\\n\\nThe three co-founders envisioned graphics-based processing as the best trajectory for tackling challenges that had eluded general-purpose computing methods.[36] As Huang later explained: \"We also observed that video games were simultaneously one of the most computationally challenging problems and would have incredibly high sales volume. Those two conditions don\\'t happen very often. Video games was our killer app — a flywheel to reach large markets funding huge R&D to solve massive computational problems.\"[36]\\n\\nThe first problem was who would quit first. Huang\\'s wife, Lori, did not want him to resign from LSI unless Malachowsky resigned from Sun at the same time, and Malachowsky\\'s wife, Melody, felt the same way about Huang.[37] Priem broke that deadlock by resigning first from Sun, effective December 31, 1992.[37] According to Priem, this put pressure on Huang and Malachowsky to not leave him to \"flail alone\", so they gave notice too.[38] Huang left LSI and \"officially joined Priem on February 17\", which was also Huang\\'s 30th birthday, while Malachowsky left Sun in early March.[38] In early 1993, the three founders began working together on their new startup in Priem\\'s townhouse in Fremont, California.[39]\\n\\nWith $40,000 in the bank, the company was born.[36] The company subsequently received $20 million of venture capital funding from Sequoia Capital, Sutter Hill Ventures and others.[40]\\n\\nDuring the late 1990s, Nvidia was one of 70 startup companies pursuing the idea that graphics acceleration for video games was the path to the future.[32] Only two survived: Nvidia and ATI Technologies, the latter of which merged into AMD.[32]\\n\\nNvidia initially had no name.[41] Priem\\'s first idea was \"Primal Graphics\", a syllabic abbreviation of two of the founders\\' last names, but that left out Huang.[41] They soon discovered it was impossible to create a workable name with syllables from all three founders\\' names, after considering \"Huaprimal\", \"Prihuamal\", \"Malluapri\", etc.[41] The next idea came from Priem\\'s idea for the name of Nvidia\\'s first product.[41] Priem originally wanted to call it the \"GXNV\", as in the \"next version\" of the GX graphics chips which he had worked on at Sun.[39] Then Huang told Priem to \"drop the GX\", resulting in the name \"NV\".[39] Priem made a list of words with the letters \"NV\" in them.[41] At one point, Malachowsky and Priem wanted to call the company NVision, but that name was already taken by a manufacturer of toilet paper.[33] Both Priem[41] and Huang have taken credit for coming up with the name Nvidia,[33] from \"invidia\", the Latin word for \"envy\".[36]\\n\\nAfter the company outgrew Priem\\'s townhouse, its original headquarters office was in Sunnyvale, California.[36]\\n\\nFirst graphics accelerator\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nNvidia\\'s first graphics accelerator, the NV1, was designed to process quadrilateral primitives (forward texture mapping), a feature that set it apart from competitors, who preferred triangle primitives.[33] However, when Microsoft introduced the DirectX platform, it chose not to support any other graphics software and announced that its Direct3D API would exclusively support triangles.[33][42] As a result, the NV1 failed to gain traction in the market.[43]\\n\\nNvidia had also entered into a partnership with Sega to supply the graphics chip for the Dreamcast console and worked on the project for about a year. However, Nvidia\\'s technology was already lagging behind competitors. This placed the company in a difficult position: continue working on a chip that was likely doomed to fail or abandon the project, risking financial collapse.[44]\\n\\nIn a pivotal moment, Sega\\'s president, Shoichiro Irimajiri, visited Huang in person to inform him that Sega had decided to choose another vendor for the Dreamcast. However, Irimajiri believed in Nvidia\\'s potential and persuaded Sega\\'s management to invest $5 million into the company. Huang later reflected that this funding was all that kept Nvidia afloat, and that Irimajiri\\'s \"understanding and generosity gave us six months to live\".[44]\\n\\nIn 1996, Huang laid off more than half of Nvidia\\'s employees—thereby reducing headcount from 100 to 40—and focused the company\\'s remaining resources on developing a graphics accelerator product optimized for processing triangle primitives: the RIVA 128.[33][42] By the time the RIVA 128 was released in August 1997, Nvidia had only enough money left for one month\\'s payroll.[33] The sense of impending failure became so pervasive that it gave rise to Nvidia\\'s unofficial company motto: \"Our company is thirty days from going out of business.\"[33] Huang began internal presentations to Nvidia staff with those words for many years.[33]\\n\\nNvidia sold about a million RIVA 128 units within four months,[33] and used the revenue to fund development of its next generation of products.[42] In 1998, the release of the RIVA TNT helped solidify Nvidia\\'s reputation as a leader in graphics technology.[45]\\n\\nPublic company\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nNvidia went public on January 22, 1999.[46][47][48] Investing in Nvidia after it had already failed to deliver on its contract turned out to be Irimajiri\\'s best decision as Sega\\'s president. After Irimajiri left Sega in 2000, Sega sold its Nvidia stock for $15 million.[44]\\n\\nIn late 1999, Nvidia released the GeForce 256 (NV10), its first product expressly marketed as a GPU, which was most notable for introducing onboard transformation and lighting (T&L) to consumer-level 3D hardware. Running at 120 MHz and featuring four-pixel pipelines, it implemented advanced video acceleration, motion compensation, and hardware sub-picture alpha blending. The GeForce outperformed existing products by a wide margin.\\n\\nDue to the success of its products, Nvidia won the contract to develop the graphics hardware for Microsoft\\'s Xbox game console, which earned Nvidia a $200 million advance. However, the project took many of its best engineers away from other projects. In the short term this did not matter, and the GeForce2 GTS shipped in the summer of 2000. In December 2000, Nvidia reached an agreement to acquire the intellectual assets of its one-time rival 3dfx, a pioneer in consumer 3D graphics technology leading the field from the mid-1990s until 2000.[49][50] The acquisition process was finalized in April 2002.[51]\\n\\nIn 2001, Standard & Poor\\'s selected Nvidia to replace the departing Enron in the S&P 500 stock index, meaning that index funds would need to hold Nvidia shares going forward.[52]\\n\\nIn July 2002, Nvidia acquired Exluna for an undisclosed sum. Exluna made software-rendering tools and the personnel were merged into the Cg project.[53] In August 2003, Nvidia acquired MediaQ for approximately US$70 million.[54] It launched GoForce the following year. On April 22, 2004, Nvidia acquired iReady, also a provider of high-performance TCP offload engines and iSCSI controllers.[55] In December 2004, it was announced that Nvidia would assist Sony with the design of the graphics processor (RSX) for the PlayStation 3 game console. On December 14, 2005, Nvidia acquired ULI Electronics, which at the time supplied third-party southbridge parts for chipsets to ATI, Nvidia\\'s competitor.[56] In March 2006, Nvidia acquired Hybrid Graphics.[57] In December 2006, Nvidia, along with its main rival in the graphics industry AMD (which had acquired ATI), received subpoenas from the U.S. Department of Justice regarding possible antitrust violations in the graphics card industry.[58]\\n\\n2007–2014\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nForbes named Nvidia its Company of the Year for 2007, citing the accomplishments it made during the said period as well as during the previous five years.[59] On January 5, 2007, Nvidia announced that it had completed the acquisition of PortalPlayer, Inc.[60] In February 2008, Nvidia acquired Ageia, developer of PhysX, a physics engine and physics processing unit. Nvidia announced that it planned to integrate the PhysX technology into its future GPU products.[61][62]\\n\\nIn July 2008, Nvidia took a write-down of approximately $200 million on its first-quarter revenue, after reporting that certain mobile chipsets and GPUs produced by the company had \"abnormal failure rates\" due to manufacturing defects. Nvidia, however, did not reveal the affected products. In September 2008, Nvidia became the subject of a class action lawsuit over the defects, claiming that the faulty GPUs had been incorporated into certain laptop models manufactured by Apple Inc., Dell, and HP. In September 2010, Nvidia reached a settlement, in which it would reimburse owners of the affected laptops for repairs or, in some cases, replacement.[63][64] On January 10, 2011, Nvidia signed a six-year, $1.5 billion cross-licensing agreement with Intel, ending all litigation between the two companies.[65]\\n\\nIn November 2011, after initially unveiling it at Mobile World Congress, Nvidia released its ARM-based system on a chip for mobile devices, Tegra 3. Nvidia claimed that the chip featured the first-ever quad-core mobile CPU.[66][67] In May 2011, it was announced that Nvidia had agreed to acquire Icera, a baseband chip making company in the UK, for $367 million.[68] In January 2013, Nvidia unveiled the Tegra 4, as well as the Nvidia Shield, an Android-based handheld game console powered by the new system on a chip.[69] On July 29, 2013, Nvidia announced that they acquired PGI from STMicroelectronics.[70]\\n\\nIn February 2013, Nvidia announced its plans to build a new headquarters in the form of two giant triangle-shaped buildings on the other side of San Tomas Expressway (to the west of its existing headquarters complex). The company selected triangles as its design theme. As Huang explained in a blog post, the triangle is \"the fundamental building block of computer graphics\".[71]\\n\\nIn 2014, Nvidia ported the Valve games Portal and Half Life 2 to its Nvidia Shield tablet as Lightspeed Studio.[72][73] Since 2014, Nvidia has diversified its business focusing on three markets: gaming, automotive electronics, and mobile devices.[74]\\n\\nThat same year, Nvidia also prevailed in litigation brought by the trustee of 3dfx\\'s bankruptcy estate to challenge its 2000 acquisition of 3dfx\\'s intellectual assets. On November 6, 2014, in an unpublished memorandum order, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the \"district court\\'s judgment affirming the bankruptcy court\\'s determination that [Nvidia] did not pay less than fair market value for assets purchased from 3dfx shortly before 3dfx filed for bankruptcy\".[75]\\n\\n2016–2018\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nOn May 6, 2016, Nvidia unveiled the first GPUs of the GeForce 10 series, the GTX 1080 and 1070, based on the company\\'s new Pascal microarchitecture. Nvidia claimed that both models outperformed its Maxwell-based Titan X model; the models incorporate GDDR5X and GDDR5 memory respectively, and use a 16 nm manufacturing process. The architecture also supports a new hardware feature known as simultaneous multi-projection (SMP), which is designed to improve the quality of multi-monitor and virtual reality rendering.[76][77][78] Laptops that include these GPUs and are sufficiently thin – as of late 2017, under 0.8 inches (20 mm) – have been designated as meeting Nvidia\\'s \"Max-Q\" design standard.[79]\\n\\nIn July 2016, Nvidia agreed to a settlement for a false advertising lawsuit regarding its GTX 970 model, as the models were unable to use all of their advertised 4 GB of VRAM due to limitations brought by the design of its hardware.[80] In May 2017, Nvidia announced a partnership with Toyota which would use Nvidia\\'s Drive PX-series artificial intelligence platform for its autonomous vehicles.[81] In July 2017, Nvidia and Chinese search giant Baidu announced a far-reaching AI partnership that includes cloud computing, autonomous driving, consumer devices, and Baidu\\'s open-source AI framework PaddlePaddle. Baidu unveiled that Nvidia\\'s Drive PX 2 AI will be the foundation of its autonomous-vehicle platform.[82]\\n\\nNvidia officially released the Titan V on December 7, 2017.[83][84]\\n\\nNvidia officially released the Nvidia Quadro GV100 on March 27, 2018.[85] Nvidia officially released the RTX 2080 GPUs on September 27, 2018. In 2018, Google announced that Nvidia\\'s Tesla P4 graphic cards would be integrated into Google Cloud service\\'s artificial intelligence.[86]\\n\\nIn May 2018, on the Nvidia user forum, a thread was started[87] asking the company to update users when they would release web drivers for its cards installed on legacy Mac Pro machines up to mid-2012 5,1 running the macOS Mojave operating system 10.14. Web drivers are required to enable graphics acceleration and multiple display monitor capabilities of the GPU. On its Mojave update info website, Apple stated that macOS Mojave would run on legacy machines with \\'Metal compatible\\' graphics cards[88] and listed Metal compatible GPUs, including some manufactured by Nvidia.[89] However, this list did not include Metal compatible cards that currently work in macOS High Sierra using Nvidia-developed web drivers. In September, Nvidia responded, \"Apple fully controls drivers for macOS. But if Apple allows, our engineers are ready and eager to help Apple deliver great drivers for macOS 10.14 (Mojave).\"[90] In October, Nvidia followed this up with another public announcement, \"Apple fully controls drivers for macOS. Unfortunately, Nvidia currently cannot release a driver unless it is approved by Apple,\"[91] suggesting a possible rift between the two companies.[92] By January 2019, with still no sign of the enabling web drivers, Apple Insider weighed into the controversy with a claim that Apple management \"doesn\\'t want Nvidia support in macOS\".[93] The following month, Apple Insider followed this up with another claim that Nvidia support was abandoned because of \"relational issues in the past\",[94] and that Apple was developing its own GPU technology.[95] Without Apple-approved Nvidia web drivers, Apple users are faced with replacing their Nvidia cards with a competing supported brand, such as AMD Radeon from the list recommended by Apple.[96]\\n\\n2019 acquisition of Mellanox Technologies\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nSee also: Mellanox Technologies\\n\\nOn March 11, 2019, Nvidia announced a deal to buy Mellanox Technologies for $6.9 billion[97] to substantially expand its footprint in the high-performance computing market. In May 2019, Nvidia announced new RTX Studio laptops. The creators say that the new laptop is going to be seven times faster than a top-end MacBook Pro with a Core i9 and AMD\\'s Radeon Pro Vega 20 graphics in apps like Maya and RedCine-X Pro.[98] In August 2019, Nvidia announced Minecraft RTX, an official Nvidia-developed patch for the game Minecraft adding real-time DXR ray tracing exclusively to the Windows 10 version of the game. The whole game is, in Nvidia\\'s words, \"refit\" with path tracing, which dramatically affects the way light, reflections, and shadows work inside the engine.[99]\\n\\n2020–2023\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nIn May 2020, Nvidia announced it was acquiring Cumulus Networks.[100] Post acquisition the company was absorbed into Nvidia\\'s networking business unit, along with Mellanox.\\n\\nIn May 2020, Nvidia\\'s developed an open-source ventilator to address the shortage resulting from the global coronavirus pandemic.[101] On May 14, 2020, Nvidia officially announced their Ampere GPU microarchitecture and the Nvidia A100 GPU accelerator.[102][103] In July 2020, it was reported that Nvidia was in talks with SoftBank to buy Arm, a UK-based chip designer, for $32 billion.[104]\\n\\nOn September 1, 2020, Nvidia officially announced the GeForce 30 series based on the company\\'s new Ampere microarchitecture.[105][106]\\n\\nOn September 13, 2020, Nvidia announced that they would buy Arm from SoftBank Group for $40 billion, subject to the usual scrutiny, with the latter retaining a 10% share of Nvidia.[107][108][109][110]\\n\\nIn October 2020, Nvidia announced its plan to build the most powerful computer in Cambridge, England. The computer, called Cambridge-1, launched in July 2021 with a $100 million investment and will employ AI to support healthcare research.[111][112] According to Jensen Huang, \"The Cambridge-1 supercomputer will serve as a hub of innovation for the UK, and further the groundbreaking work being done by the nation\\'s researchers in critical healthcare and drug discovery.\"[113]\\n\\nAlso in October 2020, along with the release of the Nvidia RTX A6000, Nvidia announced it is retiring its workstation GPU brand Quadro, shifting its product name to Nvidia RTX for future products and the manufacturing to be Nvidia Ampere architecture-based.[8]\\n\\nIn August 2021, the proposed takeover of Arm was stalled after the UK\\'s Competition and Markets Authority raised \"significant competition concerns\".[114] In October 2021, the European Commission opened a competition investigation into the takeover. The Commission stated that Nvidia\\'s acquisition could restrict competitors\\' access to Arm\\'s products and provide Nvidia with too much internal information on its competitors due to their deals with Arm. SoftBank (the parent company of Arm) and Nvidia announced in early February 2022 that they \"had agreed not to move forward with the transaction \\'because of significant regulatory challenges\\'\".[115] The investigation is set to end on March 15, 2022.[116][117] That same month, Nvidia was reportedly compromised by a cyberattack.[118]\\n\\nIn March 2022, Nvidia\\'s CEO Jensen Huang mentioned that they are open to having Intel manufacture their chips in the future.[119] This was the first time the company mentioned that they would work together with Intel\\'s upcoming foundry services.\\n\\nIn April 2022, it was reported that Nvidia planned to open a new research center in Yerevan, Armenia.[120]\\n\\nIn May 2022, Nvidia opened Voyager, the second of the two giant buildings at its new headquarters complex to the west of the old one. Unlike its smaller and older sibling Endeavor, the triangle theming is used more \"sparingly\" in Voyager.[121][122]\\n\\nIn September 2022, Nvidia announced its next-generation automotive-grade chip, Drive Thor.[123][124]\\n\\nIn September 2022, Nvidia announced a collaboration with the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard related to the entire suite of Nvidia\\'s AI-powered healthcare software suite called Clara, that includes Parabricks and MONAI.[125]\\n\\nFollowing U.S. Department of Commerce regulations which placed an embargo on exports to China of advanced microchips, which went into effect in October 2022, Nvidia saw its data center chip added to the export control list. The next month, the company unveiled a new advanced chip in China, called the A800 GPU, that met the export control rules.[126]\\n\\nIn September 2023, Getty Images announced that it was partnering with Nvidia to launch Generative AI by Getty Images, a new tool that lets people create images using Getty\\'s library of licensed photos. Getty will use Nvidia\\'s Edify model, which is available on Nvidia\\'s generative AI model library Picasso.[127]\\n\\nOn September 26, 2023, Denny\\'s CEO Kelli Valade joined Huang in East San Jose to celebrate the founding of Nvidia at Denny\\'s on Berryessa Road, where a plaque was installed to mark the relevant corner booth as the birthplace of a $1 trillion company.[33][128] By then, Nvidia\\'s H100 GPUs were in such demand that even other tech giants were beholden to how Nvidia allocated supply. Larry Ellison of Oracle Corporation said that month that during a dinner with Huang at Nobu in Palo Alto, he and Elon Musk of Tesla, Inc. and xAI \"were begging\" for H100s, \"I guess is the best way to describe it. An hour of sushi and begging\".[129]\\n\\nIn October 2023, it was reported that Nvidia had quietly begun designing ARM-based central processing units (CPUs) for Microsoft\\'s Windows operating system with a target to start selling them in 2025.[130]\\n\\n2024–2025\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nIn January 2024, Forbes reported that Nvidia has increased its lobbying presence in Washington, D.C. as American lawmakers consider proposals to regulate artificial intelligence. From 2023 to 2024, the company reportedly hired at least four government affairs with professional backgrounds at agencies including the United States Department of State and the Department of the Treasury. It was noted that the $350,000 spent by the company on lobbying in 2023 was small compared to a number of major tech companies in the artificial intelligence space.[131]\\n\\nIn January 2024, Raymond James Financial analysts estimated that Nvidia was selling the H100 GPU in the price range of $25,000 to $30,000 each, while on eBay, individual H100s cost over $40,000.[132] Several major technology companies were purchasing tens or hundreds of thousands of GPUs for their data centers to run generative artificial intelligence projects; simple arithmetic implied that they were committing to billions of dollars in capital expenditures.[132]\\n\\nIn February 2024, it was reported that Nvidia was the \"hot employer\" in Silicon Valley because it was offering interesting work and good pay at a time when other tech employers were downsizing. Half of Nvidia employees earned over $228,000 in 2023.[133] By then, Nvidia GPUs had become so valuable that they needed special security while in transit to data centers. Cisco chief information officer Fletcher Previn explained at a CIO summit: \"Those GPUs arrive by armored car\".[134]\\n\\nOn March 1, 2024, Nvidia became the third company in the history of the United States to close with a market capitalization in excess of $2 trillion.[52] Nvidia needed only 180 days to get to $2 trillion from $1 trillion, while the first two companies, Apple and Microsoft, each took over 500 days.[52] On March 18, Nvidia announced its new AI chip and microarchitecture Blackwell, named after mathematician David Blackwell.[135]\\n\\nIn April 2024, Reuters reported that China had allegedly acquired banned Nvidia chips and servers from Supermicro and Dell via tenders.[136]\\n\\nIn June 2024, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Justice Department (DOJ) began antitrust investigations into Nvidia, Microsoft and OpenAI, focusing on their influence in the AI industry. The FTC led the investigations into Microsoft and OpenAI, while the DOJ handled Nvidia. The probes centered on the companies\\' conduct rather than mergers. This development followed an open letter from OpenAI employees expressing concerns about the rapid AI advancements and lack of oversight.[137]\\n\\nThe company became the world\\'s most valuable, surpassing Microsoft and Apple, on June 18, 2024, after its market capitalization exceeded $3.3 trillion.[138][139]\\n\\nIn June 2024, Trend Micro announced a partnership with Nvidia to develop AI-driven security tools, notably to protect the data centers where AI workloads are processed. This collaboration integrates Nvidia NIM and Nvidia Morpheus with Trend Vision One and its Sovereign and Private Cloud solutions to improve data privacy, real-time analysis, and rapid threat mitigation.[140]\\n\\nNvidia introduced in October 2024 a family of open-source multimodal large language models called NVLM 1.0, which features a flagship version with 72 billion parameters, designed to improve text-only performance after multimodal training.[141][142]\\n\\nIn November 2024, the company was added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average.[143][144]\\n\\nIn November 2024, Morgan Stanley reported that \"the entire 2025 production\" of all of Nvidia\\'s Blackwell chips was \"already sold out\".[145]\\n\\nAlso in November 2024, the company bought 1.2 million shares of Nebius Group.[146]\\n\\nNvidia was ranked #3 on Forbes\\' \"Best Places to Work\" list in 2024.[147]\\n\\nIn January 2025, Nvidia saw the largest one-day loss in market capitalization for a U.S. company in history at $600 billion. This was due to DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup that developed an advanced AI model at a lower cost and computing power.[148] DeepSeek\\'s AI assistant, using the V3 model, surpassed ChatGPT as the highest-rated free app in the U.S. on Apple\\'s App Store.[149][150]\\n\\nOn 7 April 2025, Nvidia released the Llama-3.1-Nemotron-Ultra-253B-v1 reasoning large language model, under the Nvidia Open Model License. It comes in three sizes: Nano, Super and Ultra.[151]\\n\\nFabless manufacturing\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nNvidia uses external suppliers for all phases of manufacturing, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing, and packaging. Nvidia thus avoids most of the investment and production costs and risks associated with chip manufacturing, although it does sometimes directly procure some components and materials used in the production of its products (e.g., memory and substrates). Nvidia focuses its own resources on product design, quality assurance, marketing, and customer support.[152][153]\\n\\nCorporate affairs\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nBusiness unit Sales (billion $) Share Compute & networking 47.4 77.8% Graphics 13.5 22.2%\\n\\nRegion Sales (billion $) Share United States 27.0 44.3% Taiwan 13.4 22.0% China 10.3 16.9% Other countries 10.2 16.8%\\n\\nLeadership\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nNvidia\\'s key management as of March 2024 consists of:[155]\\n\\nJensen Huang, founder, president and chief executive officer\\n\\nChris Malachowsky, founder and Nvidia fellow\\n\\nColette Kress, executive vice president and chief financial officer\\n\\nJay Puri, executive vice president of worldwide field operations\\n\\nDebora Shoquist, executive vice president of operations\\n\\nTim Teter, executive vice president, general counsel and secretary\\n\\nBoard of directors\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nAs of November 2024[update], the company\\'s board consisted of the following directors:[156]\\n\\nRob Burgess (former chief executive officer of Macromedia Inc.)\\n\\nTench Coxe (former managing director of Sutter Hill Ventures)\\n\\nJohn Dabiri (engineer and professor at the California Institute of Technology)\\n\\nPersis Drell (physicist and professor at Stanford University)\\n\\nJensen Huang (co-founder, CEO and president of Nvidia)\\n\\nDawn Hudson (former Chief Marketing Officer of the National Football League)\\n\\nHarvey C.

According to the financial chief of the company, Colette Kress, the effects of the pandemic will \"likely reflect this evolution in enterprise workforce trends with a greater focus on technologies, such as Nvidia laptops and virtual workstations, that enable remote work and virtual collaboration.\"[159] In May 2023, Nvidia crossed $1 trillion in market valuation during trading hours,[160] and grew to $1.2 trillion by the following November.[161] For its strength, size and market capitalization, Nvidia has been selected to be one of Bloomberg\\'s \"Magnificent Seven\", the seven biggest companies on the stock market in these regards.\\n\\nOwnership\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nThe 10 largest shareholders of Nvidia in early 2024 were:[154]\\n\\nThe Vanguard Group (8.280%)\\n\\nBlackRock (5.623%)\\n\\nFidelity Investments (5.161%)\\n\\nState Street Corporation (3.711%)\\n\\nJensen Huang (3.507%)\\n\\nGeode Capital Management (2.024%)\\n\\nT. Rowe Price (2.013%)\\n\\nJPMorgan Chase (1.417%)\\n\\nBlackRock Life (1.409%)\\n\\nEaton Vance (1.337%)\\n\\nGPU Technology Conference\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nMain article: Nvidia GTC\\n\\nNvidia\\'s GPU Technology Conference (GTC) is a series of technical conferences held around the world.[162] It originated in 2009 in San Jose, California, with an initial focus on the potential for solving computing challenges through GPUs.[163] In recent years, the conference\\'s focus has shifted to various applications of artificial intelligence and deep learning; including self-driving cars, healthcare, high-performance computing, and Nvidia Deep Learning Institute (DLI) training.[164] GTC 2018 attracted over 8400 attendees.[162] GTC 2020 was converted to a digital event and drew roughly 59,000 registrants.[165] After several years of remote-only events, GTC in March 2024 returned to an in-person format in San Jose, California.[166]\\n\\nProduct families\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nNvidia\\'s product families include graphics processing units, wireless communication devices, and automotive hardware and software, such as:\\n\\nGeForce, consumer-oriented graphics processing products\\n\\nRTX, professional visual computing graphics processing products (replacing GTX and Quadro)\\n\\nNVS, a multi-display business graphics processor\\n\\nTegra, a system on a chip series for mobile devices\\n\\nTesla, line of dedicated general-purpose GPUs for high-end image generation applications in professional and scientific fields\\n\\nnForce, a motherboard chipset created by Nvidia for Intel (Celeron, Pentium and Core 2) and AMD (Athlon and Duron) microprocessors\\n\\nGRID, a set of hardware and services by Nvidia for graphics virtualization\\n\\nShield, a range of gaming hardware including the Shield Portable, Shield Tablet and Shield TV\\n\\nDrive, a range of hardware and software products for designers and manufacturers of autonomous vehicles. The Drive PX-series is a high-performance computer platform aimed at autonomous driving through deep learning,[167] while Driveworks is an operating system for driverless cars.[168]\\n\\nBlueField, a range of data processing units, initially inherited from their acquisition of Mellanox Technologies[169][170]\\n\\nDatacenter/server class CPU, codenamed Grace, released in 2023[171][172]\\n\\nDGX, an enterprise platform designed for deep learning applications\\n\\nMaxine, a platform providing developers a suite of AI-based conferencing software[173]\\n\\nOpen-source software support\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nSee also: Free and open-source graphics device driver, Mesa 3D, nouveau (software), and OpenPOWER Foundation\\n\\nUntil September 23, 2013, Nvidia had not published any documentation for its advanced hardware,[174] meaning that programmers could not write free and open-source device driver for its products without resorting to reverse engineering.\\n\\nInstead, Nvidia provides its own binary GeForce graphics drivers for X.Org and an open-source library that interfaces with the Linux, FreeBSD or Solaris kernels and the proprietary graphics software. Nvidia also provided but stopped supporting an obfuscated open-source driver that only supports two-dimensional hardware acceleration and ships with the X.Org distribution.[175]\\n\\nThe proprietary nature of Nvidia\\'s drivers has generated dissatisfaction within free-software communities. In a 2012 talk, Linus Torvalds, in criticism of Nvidia\\'s approach towards Linux, raised the finger and stated \"Nvidia, fuck you.\"[176][177] Some Linux and BSD users insist on using only open-source drivers and regard Nvidia\\'s insistence on providing nothing more than a binary-only driver as inadequate, given that competing manufacturers such as Intel offer support and documentation for open-source developers and that others (like AMD) release partial documentation and provide some active development.[178][179]\\n\\nNvidia only provides x86/x64 and ARMv7-A versions of their proprietary driver; as a result, features like CUDA are unavailable on other platforms.[180] Some users claim that Nvidia\\'s Linux drivers impose artificial restrictions, like limiting the number of monitors that can be used at the same time, but the company has not commented on these accusations.[181]\\n\\nIn 2014, with Maxwell GPUs, Nvidia started to require firmware by them to unlock all features of its graphics cards.[182][183][184]\\n\\nOn May 12, 2022, Nvidia announced that they are opensourcing their GPU kernel modules.[185][186][187] Support for Nvidia\\'s firmware was implemented in nouveau in 2023, which allows proper power management and GPU reclocking for Turing and newer graphics card generations.[188][189]\\n\\nDeep learning\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nNvidia GPUs are used in deep learning, and accelerated analytics due to Nvidia\\'s CUDA software platform and API which allows programmers to utilize the higher number of cores present in GPUs to parallelize BLAS operations which are extensively used in machine learning algorithms.[12] They were included in many Tesla, Inc. vehicles before Musk announced at Tesla Autonomy Day in 2019 that the company developed its own SoC and full self-driving computer now and would stop using Nvidia hardware for their vehicles.[190][191] These GPUs are used by researchers, laboratories, tech companies and enterprise companies.[192] In 2009, Nvidia was involved in what was called the \"big bang\" of deep learning, \"as deep-learning neural networks were combined with Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs)\".[193] That year, the Google Brain team used Nvidia GPUs to create deep neural networks capable of machine learning, where Andrew Ng determined that GPUs could increase the speed of deep learning systems by about 100 times.[194]\\n\\nDGX\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nMain article: Nvidia DGX\\n\\nDGX is a line of supercomputers by Nvidia.\\n\\nIn April 2016, Nvidia produced the DGX-1 based on an 8 GPU cluster, to improve the ability of users to use deep learning by combining GPUs with integrated deep learning software.[195] Nvidia gifted its first DGX-1 to OpenAI in August 2016 to help it train larger and more complex AI models with the capability of reducing processing time from six days to two hours.[196][197] It also developed Nvidia Tesla K80 and P100 GPU-based virtual machines, which are available through Google Cloud, which Google installed in November 2016.[198] Microsoft added GPU servers in a preview offering of its N series based on Nvidia\\'s Tesla K80s, each containing 4992 processing cores. Later that year, AWS\\'s P2 instance was produced using up to 16 Nvidia Tesla K80 GPUs. That month Nvidia also partnered with IBM to create a software kit that boosts the AI capabilities of Watson,[199] called IBM PowerAI.[200][201] Nvidia also offers its own Nvidia Deep Learning software development kit.[202] In 2017, the GPUs were also brought online at the Riken Center for Advanced Intelligence Project for Fujitsu.[203] The company\\'s deep learning technology led to a boost in its 2017 earnings.[204]\\n\\nIn May 2018, researchers at the artificial intelligence department of Nvidia realized the possibility that a robot can learn to perform a job simply by observing the person doing the same job. They have created a system that, after a short revision and testing, can already be used to control the universal robots of the next generation. In addition to GPU manufacturing, Nvidia provides parallel processing capabilities to researchers and scientists that allow them to efficiently run high-performance applications.[205]\\n\\nRobotics\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nIn 2020, Nvidia unveiled \"Omniverse\", a virtual environment designed for engineers.[206] Nvidia also open-sourced Isaac Sim, which makes use of this Omniverse to train robots through simulations that mimic the physics of the robots and the real world.[207][208]\\n\\nIn 2024, Huang oriented Nvidia\\'s focus towards humanoid robots and self-driving cars, which he expects to gain widespread adoption.[209][210]\\n\\nIn 2025, Nvidia announced Isaac GR00T N1, an open-source, foundation model \"designed to expedite the development and capabilities of humanoid robots\". Neura Robotics, 1X Technologies and Vention are among the first companies to use the model.[211][212][213]\\n\\nInception Program\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nNvidia\\'s Inception Program was created to support startups making exceptional advances in the fields of artificial intelligence and data science. Award winners are announced at Nvidia\\'s GTC Conference. In May 2017, the program had 1,300 companies.[214] As of March 2018, there were 2,800 startups in the Inception Program.[215] As of August 2021, the program has surpassed 8,500 members in 90 countries, with cumulative funding of US$60 billion.[216]\\n\\nControversies\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nMaxwell advertising dispute\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nMain article: GeForce 900 series § Advertising controversy\\n\\nGTX 970 hardware specifications\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nIssues with the GeForce GTX 970\\'s specifications were first brought up by users when they found out that the cards, while featuring 4 GB of memory, rarely accessed memory over the 3.5 GB boundary. Further testing and investigation eventually led to Nvidia issuing a statement that the card\\'s initially announced specifications had been altered without notice before the card was made commercially available, and that the card took a performance hit once memory over the 3.5 GB limit were put into use.[217][218][219]\\n\\nThe card\\'s back-end hardware specifications, initially announced as being identical to those of the GeForce GTX 980, differed in the amount of L2 cache (1.75 MB versus 2 MB in the GeForce GTX 980) and the number of ROPs (56 versus 64 in the 980). Additionally, it was revealed that the card was designed to access its memory as a 3.5 GB section, plus a 0.5 GB one, access to the latter being 7 times slower than the first one.[220] The company then went on to promise a specific driver modification to alleviate the performance issues produced by the cutbacks suffered by the card.[221] However, Nvidia later clarified that the promise had been a miscommunication and there would be no specific driver update for the GTX 970.[222] Nvidia claimed that it would assist customers who wanted refunds in obtaining them.[223] On February 26, 2015, Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang went on record in Nvidia\\'s official blog to apologize for the incident.[224] In February 2015 a class-action lawsuit alleging false advertising was filed against Nvidia and Gigabyte Technology in the U.S. District Court for Northern California.[225][226]\\n\\nNvidia revealed that it is able to disable individual units, each containing 256 KB of L2 cache and 8 ROPs, without disabling whole memory controllers.[227] This comes at the cost of dividing the memory bus into high speed and low speed segments that cannot be accessed at the same time unless one segment is reading while the other segment is writing because the L2/ROP unit managing both of the GDDR5 controllers shares the read return channel and the write data bus between the two GDDR5 controllers and itself.[227] This is used in the GeForce GTX 970, which therefore can be described as having 3.5 GB in its high speed segment on a 224-bit bus and 0.5 GB in a low speed segment on a 32-bit bus.[227]\\n\\nOn July 27, 2016, Nvidia agreed to a preliminary settlement of the U.S. class action lawsuit,[225] offering a $30 refund on GTX 970 purchases. The agreed upon refund represents the portion of the cost of the storage and performance capabilities the consumers assumed they were obtaining when they purchased the card.[228]\\n\\nGeForce Partner Program\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nMain article: GeForce Partner Program\\n\\nThe Nvidia GeForce Partner Program was a marketing program designed to provide partnering companies with benefits such as public relations support, video game bundling, and marketing development funds.[229] The program proved to be controversial, with complaints about it possibly being an anti-competitive practice.[230]\\n\\nFirst announced in a blog post on March 1, 2018,[231] it was canceled on May 4, 2018.[232]\\n\\nHardware Unboxed\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nOn December 10, 2020, Nvidia told YouTube tech reviewer Steven Walton of Hardware Unboxed that it would no longer supply him with GeForce Founders Edition graphics card review units.[233][234] In a Twitter message, Hardware Unboxed said, \"Nvidia have officially decided to ban us from receiving GeForce Founders Edition GPU review samples. Their reasoning is that we are focusing on rasterization instead of ray tracing. They have said they will revisit this \\'should your editorial direction change.\\'\"[235]\\n\\nIn emails that were disclosed by Walton from Nvidia Senior PR Manager Bryan Del Rizzo, Nvidia had said:\\n\\n...your GPU reviews and recommendations have continued to focus singularly on rasterization performance, and you have largely discounted all of the other technologies we offer gamers. It is very clear from your community commentary that you do not see things the same way that we, gamers, and the rest of the industry do.[236]\\n\\nTechSpot, partner site of Hardware Unboxed, said, \"this and other related incidents raise serious questions around journalistic independence and what they are expecting of reviewers when they are sent products for an unbiased opinion.\"[236]\\n\\nA number of technology reviewers came out strongly against Nvidia\\'s move.[237][238] Linus Sebastian, of Linus Tech Tips, titled the episode of his weekly WAN Show, \"NVIDIA might ACTUALLY be EVIL...\"[239] and was highly critical of the company\\'s move to dictate specific outcomes of technology reviews.[240] The review site Gamers Nexus said it was, \"Nvidia\\'s latest decision to shoot both its feet: They\\'ve now made it so that any reviewers covering RT will become subject to scrutiny from untrusting viewers who will suspect subversion by the company. Shortsighted self-own from NVIDIA.\"[241]\\n\\nTwo days later, Nvidia reversed their stance.[242][243] Hardware Unboxed sent out a Twitter message, \"I just received an email from Nvidia apologizing for the previous email & they\\'ve now walked everything back.\"[244][237] On December 14, Hardware Unboxed released a video explaining the controversy from their viewpoint.[245] Via Twitter, they also shared a second apology sent by Nvidia\\'s Del Rizzo that said \"to withhold samples because I didn\\'t agree with your commentary is simply inexcusable and crossed the line.\"[246][247]\\n\\nImproper disclosures about cryptomining\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nIn 2018, Nvidia\\'s chips became popular for cryptomining, the process of obtaining crypto rewards in exchange for verifying transactions on distributed ledgers, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said. However, the company failed to disclose that it was a \"significant element\" of its revenue growth from sales of chips designed for gaming, the SEC further added in a statement and charging order. Those omissions misled investors and analysts who were interested in understanding the impact of cryptomining on Nvidia\\'s business, the SEC emphasized. Nvidia, which did not admit or deny the findings, has agreed to pay $5.5 million to settle civil charges, according to a statement made by the SEC in May 2022.[248]\\n\\nFrench Competition Authority Investigation\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nOn September 26, 2023, Nvidia\\'s French offices were searched by the French Competition Authority. The raid, authorized by a judge, was part of an investigation into suspected anti-competitive practices in the graphics card sector. Nvidia has not publicly commented on the incident.[249]\\n\\nSee also\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\n\\n\\nSan Francisco Bay Area portal\\n\\n\\n\\nCompanies portal\\n\\nicon\\n\\nElectronics portal\\n\\nicon\\n\\nTechnology portal\\n\\nFast approximate anti-aliasing\\n\\nGeneral-purpose computing on graphics processing units\\n\\nHuang\\'s law\\n\\nMolecular modeling on GPUs\\n\\nGPU workstations\\n\\nGroq\\n\\nNotes\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\n^ Officially written as NVIDIA and stylized in its logo as nVIDIA with the lowercase \"n\" the same height as the uppercase \"VIDIA\"; formerly stylized as nVIDIA with a large italicized lowercase \"n\" on products from the mid 1990s to early-mid 2000s.[3] The unofficial capitalization nVidia may be found within enthusiast communities and publications.[4]\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\n^ \"NVIDIA 2024 10K\".

Meta owns and operates several prominent social media platforms and communication services, including Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp. The company also operates an advertising network for its own sites and third parties; as of 2023[update], advertising accounted for 97.8 percent of its total revenue.[9]\\n\\nThe company was originally established in 2004 as TheFacebook, Inc.,[10] and was renamed Facebook, Inc. in 2005.[11] In 2021, it rebranded as Meta Platforms, Inc. to reflect a strategic shift toward developing the metaverse—an interconnected digital ecosystem spanning virtual and augmented reality technologies.[12][13][14][15]\\n\\nMeta is considered one of the Big Five American technology companies, alongside Alphabet (Google), Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft. In 2023, it was ranked 31st on the Forbes Global 2000 list of the world\\'s largest public companies.[16] As of 2022, it was the world\\'s third-largest spender on research and development, with R&D expenses totaling US$35.3 billion.[17]\\n\\nHistory\\n\\nFurther information: History of Facebook and Initial public offering of Facebook\\n\\nThis article is part of a series about Meta Platforms  History Instagram WhatsApp Acquisitions Products and services Facebook 2021 outage Features Dating Feed Like button Reels Other products Instagram Threads Messenger Kids Meta AI Meta Portal Quest Quest 2 Quest 3 Quest 3S Quest Pro Supernatural Ray-Ban Stories WhatsApp People Executives and board members Mark Zuckerberg Sheryl Sandberg Notable employees Adam Mosseri Related organizations Oversight Board Business Criticism Privacy concerns Content management Censorship of Censorship by Cambridge Analytica data scandal 2020 ad boycotts 2021 company files leak WhatsApp security and privacy features WhatsApp snooping scandal Litigation Young v.

IPO v t e\\n\\nFacebook filed for an initial public offering (IPO) on January 1, 2012.[18] The preliminary prospectus stated that the company sought to raise $5 billion, had 845 million monthly active users, and a website accruing 2.7 billion likes and comments daily.[19] After the IPO, Zuckerberg would retain 22% of the total shares and 57% of the total voting power in Facebook.[20]\\n\\nUnderwriters valued the shares at $38 each, valuing the company at $104 billion, the largest valuation yet for a newly public company.[21] On May 16, one day before the IPO, Facebook announced it would sell 25% more shares than originally planned due to high demand.[22] The IPO raised $16 billion, making it the third-largest in US history (slightly ahead of AT&T Mobility and behind only General Motors and Visa). The stock price left the company with a higher market capitalization than all but a few U.S. corporations—surpassing heavyweights such as Amazon, McDonald\\'s, Disney, and Kraft Foods—and made Zuckerberg\\'s stock worth $19 billion.[23][24] The New York Times stated that the offering overcame questions about Facebook\\'s difficulties in attracting advertisers to transform the company into a \"must-own stock\". Jimmy Lee of JPMorgan Chase described it as \"the next great blue-chip\".[23] Writers at TechCrunch, on the other hand, expressed skepticism, stating, \"That\\'s a big multiple to live up to, and Facebook will likely need to add bold new revenue streams to justify the mammoth valuation.\"[25]\\n\\nTrading in the stock, which began on May 18, was delayed that day due to technical problems with the Nasdaq exchange.[26] The stock struggled to stay above the IPO price for most of the day, forcing underwriters to buy back shares to support the price.[27] At the closing bell, shares were valued at $38.23,[28] only $0.23 above the IPO price and down $3.82 from the opening bell value. The opening was widely described by the financial press as a disappointment.[29] The stock nonetheless set a new record for trading volume of an IPO.[30] On May 25, 2012, the stock ended its first full week of trading at $31.91, a 16.5% decline.[31]\\n\\nOn May 22, 2012, regulators from Wall Street\\'s Financial Industry Regulatory Authority announced that they had begun to investigate whether banks underwriting Facebook had improperly shared information only with select clients rather than the general public.

Galvin subpoenaed Morgan Stanley over the same issue.[32] The allegations sparked \"fury\" among some investors and led to the immediate filing of several lawsuits, one of them a class action suit claiming more than $2.5 billion in losses due to the IPO.[33] Bloomberg estimated that retail investors may have lost approximately $630 million on Facebook stock since its debut.[34] S&P Global Ratings added Facebook to its S&P 500 index on December 21, 2013.[35]\\n\\nOn May 2, 2014, Zuckerberg announced that the company would be changing its internal motto from \"Move fast and break things\" to \"Move fast with stable infrastructure\".[36][37] The earlier motto had been described as Zuckerberg\\'s \"prime directive to his developers and team\" in a 2009 interview in Business Insider, in which he also said, \"Unless you are breaking stuff, you are not moving fast enough.\"[38]\\n\\n2018–2020: Focus on the metaverse\\n\\nLasso was a short-video sharing app from Facebook similar to TikTok that was launched on iOS and Android in 2018 and was aimed at teenagers. On July 2, 2020, Facebook announced that Lasso would be shutting down on July 10.[39][40][41]\\n\\nIn 2018, the Oculus lead Jason Rubin sent his 50-page vision document titled \"The Metaverse\" to Facebook\\'s leadership. In the document, Rubin acknowledged that Facebook\\'s virtual reality business had not caught on as expected, despite the hundreds of millions of dollars spent on content for early adopters. He also urged the company to execute fast and invest heavily in the vision, to shut out HTC, Apple, Google and other competitors in the VR space. Regarding other players\\' participation in the metaverse vision, he called for the company to build the \"metaverse\" to prevent their competitors from \"being in the VR business in a meaningful way at all\".[42]\\n\\nIn May 2019, Facebook founded Libra Networks, reportedly to develop their own stablecoin cryptocurrency.[43] Later, it was reported that Libra was being supported by financial companies such as Visa, Mastercard, PayPal and Uber. The consortium of companies was expected to pool in $10 million each to fund the launch of the cryptocurrency coin named Libra.[44] Depending on when it would receive approval from the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory authority to operate as a payments service, the Libra Association had planned to launch a limited format cryptocurrency in 2021.[45] Libra was renamed Diem, before being shut down and sold in January 2022 after backlash from Swiss government regulators and the public.[46][47]\\n\\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of online services, including Facebook, grew globally.[48] Zuckerberg predicted this would be a \"permanent acceleration\" that would continue after the pandemic. Facebook hired aggressively, growing from 48,268 employees in March 2020 to more than 87,000 by September 2022.[48]\\n\\n2021: Rebrand as Meta\\n\\nFurther information: Criticism of Facebook, Instagram § Impact on people, 2021 Facebook leak, and Frances Haugen\\n\\nSee also: Facebook–Cambridge Analytica data scandal and 2020 Facebook ad boycotts\\n\\nFollowing a period of intense scrutiny and damaging whistleblower leaks, news started to emerge on October 21, 2021 about Facebook\\'s plan to rebrand the company and change its name.[12][49] In the Q3 2021 Earnings Call on October 25, Mark Zuckerberg discussed the ongoing criticism of the company\\'s social services and the way it operates, and pointed to the pivoting efforts to building the metaverse – without mentioning the rebranding and the name change.[50] The metaverse vision and the name change from Facebook, Inc. to Meta Platforms was introduced at Facebook Connect on October 28, 2021.[13] Based on Facebook\\'s PR campaign, the name change reflects the company\\'s shifting long term focus of building the metaverse, a digital extension of the physical world by social media, virtual reality and augmented reality features.[13][51]\\n\\n\"Meta\" had been registered as a trademark in the United States in 2018 (after an initial filing in 2015) for marketing, advertising, and computer services, by a Canadian company that provided big data analysis of scientific literature.[52] This company was acquired in 2017 by the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI), a foundation established by Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, and became one of their projects.[53] Following the rebranding announcement, CZI announced that it had already decided to deprioritize the earlier Meta project, thus it would be transferring its rights to the name to Meta Platforms, and the previous project would end in 2022.[54]\\n\\n2022: Declining profits and mass lay-offs\\n\\nSoon after the rebranding, in early February 2022, Meta reported a greater-than-expected decline in profits in the fourth quarter of 2021.[55] It reported no growth in monthly users,[56] and indicated it expected revenue growth to stall.[55] It also expected measures taken by Apple Inc. to protect user privacy to cost it some $10 billion in advertisement revenue, an amount equal to roughly 8% of its revenue for 2021.[57] In meeting with Meta staff the day after earnings were reported, Zuckerberg blamed competition for user attention, particularly from video-based apps such as TikTok.[58]\\n\\nThe 27% reduction in the company\\'s share price which occurred in reaction to the news eliminated some $230 billion of value from Meta\\'s market capitalization.[56] Bloomberg described the decline as \"an epic rout that, in its sheer scale, is unlike anything Wall Street or Silicon Valley has ever seen\".[56] Zuckerberg\\'s net worth fell by as much as $31 billion.[59] Zuckerberg owns 13% of Meta, and the holding makes up the bulk of his wealth.[60][61]\\n\\nAccording to published reports by Bloomberg on March 30, 2022, Meta turned over data such as phone numbers, physical addresses, and IP addresses to hackers posing as law enforcement officials using forged documents. The law enforcement requests sometimes included forged signatures of real or fictional officials. When asked about the allegations, a Meta representative said, \"We review every data request for legal sufficiency and use advanced systems and processes to validate law enforcement requests and detect abuse.\"[62] In June 2022, Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer of 14 years, announced she would step down that year. Zuckerberg said that Javier Olivan would replace Sandberg, though in a “more traditional” role.[63]\\n\\nIn March 2022, Meta (except Meta-owned WhatsApp) and Instagram were banned in Russia and added to the Russian list of terrorist and extremist organizations for alleged Russophobia and hate speech (up to genocidal calls) amid the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine.[64] Meta appealed against the ban, but it was upheld by a Moscow court in June of the same year.[64]\\n\\nAlso in March 2022, Meta and Italian eyewear giant Luxottica released Ray-Ban Stories, a series of smartglasses which could play music and take pictures. Meta and Luxottica parent company EssilorLuxottica declined to disclose sales on the line of products as of September 2022, though Meta has expressed satisfaction with its customer feedback.[65][66][67]\\n\\nIn July 2022, Meta saw its first year-on-year revenue decline when its total revenue slipped by 1% to $28.8bn.[68] Analysts and journalists accredited the loss to its advertising business, which has been limited by Apple\\'s app tracking transparency feature and the number of people who have opted not to be tracked by Meta apps. Zuckerberg also accredited the decline to increasing competition from TikTok.[69][70][71] On October 27, 2022, Meta\\'s market value dropped to $268 billion, a loss of around $700 billion compared to 2021, and its shares fell by 24%. It lost its spot among the top 20 US companies by market cap, despite reaching the top 5 in the previous year.[72]\\n\\nIn November 2022, Meta laid off 11,000 employees, 13% of its workforce. Zuckerberg said the decision to aggressively increase Meta\\'s investments had been a mistake, as he had wrongly predicted that the surge in e-commerce would last beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. He also attributed the decline to increased competition, a global economic downturn and \"ads signal loss\".[73] Plans to lay off a further 10,000 employees began in April 2023.[74] The layoffs were part of a general downturn in the technology industry, alongside layoffs by companies including Google, Amazon, Tesla, Snap, Twitter and Lyft.[75][76]\\n\\nStarting from 2022, Meta scrambled to catch up to other tech companies in adopting specialized artificial intelligence hardware and software. It had been using less expensive CPUs instead of GPUs for AI work, but that approach turned out to be less efficient.[77]\\n\\nSince 2023: Threads, AI and all-time high stock value\\n\\nIn 2023, Ireland\\'s Data Protection Commissioner imposed a record EUR 1.2 billion fine on Meta for transferring data from Europe to the United States without adequate protections for EU citizens.[78]: 250\\n\\nIn March 2023, Meta announced a new round of layoffs that would cut 10,000 employees and close 5,000 open positions to make the company more efficient.[79] Meta revenue surpassed analyst expectations for the first quarter of 2023 after announcing that it was increasing its focus on AI.[80] On July 6, Meta launched a new app, Threads, a competitor to Twitter.[81]\\n\\nMeta announced its artificial intelligence model Llama 2 in July 2023, available for commercial use via partnerships with major cloud providers like Microsoft. It was the first project to be unveiled out of Meta\\'s generative AI group after it was set up in February. It would not charge access or usage but instead operate with an open-source model to allow Meta to ascertain what improvements need to be made. Prior to this announcement, Meta said it had no plans to release Llama 2 for commercial use. An earlier version of Llama was released to academics.[82][83]\\n\\nIn August 2023, Meta announced its permanent removal of news content from Facebook and Instagram in Canada due to the Online News Act, which requires Canadian news outlets to be compensated for content shared on its platform. The Online News Act was in effect by year-end, but Meta will not participate in the regulatory process.[84] In October 2023, Zuckerberg said that AI would be Meta\\'s biggest investment area in 2024.[85] Meta finished 2023 as one of the best-performing technology stocks of the year, with its share price up 150 percent.[86] Its stock reached an all-time high in January 2024, bringing Meta within 2% of achieving $1 trillion market capitalization.[87]\\n\\nIn November 2023 Meta Platforms launched an ad-free service in Europe, allowing subscribers to opt-out of personal data being collected for targeted advertising. A group of 28 European organizations, including Max Schrems\\' advocacy group NOYB, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, Wikimedia Europe, and the Electronic Privacy Information Center, signed a 2024 letter to the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) expressing concern that this subscriber model would undermine privacy protections, specifically GDPR data protection standards.[88]\\n\\nMeta removed the Facebook and Instagram accounts of Iran\\'s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei in February 2024, citing repeated violations of its Dangerous Organizations & Individuals policy.[89] As of March, Meta was under investigation by the FDA for alleged use of their social media platforms to sell illegal drugs.[90] On 16 May 2024, the European Commission began an investigation into Meta over concerns related to child safety.[91][92][93][94]\\n\\nIn May 2023, Iraqi social media influencer Esaa Ahmed-Adnan encountered a troubling issue when Instagram removed his posts, citing false copyright violations despite his content being original and free from copyrighted material. He discovered that extortionists were behind these takedowns, offering to restore his content for $3,000 or provide ongoing protection for $1,000 per month. This scam, exploiting Meta’s rights management tools, became widespread in the Middle East, revealing a gap in Meta’s enforcement in developing regions. An Iraqi nonprofit Tech4Peace’s founder, Aws al-Saadi helped Ahmed-Adnan and others, but the restoration process was slow, leading to significant financial losses for many victims, including prominent figures like Ammar al-Hakim. This situation highlighted Meta’s challenges in balancing global growth with effective content moderation and protection.[95]\\n\\nOn 16 September 2024, Meta announced it had banned Russian state media outlets from its platforms worldwide due to concerns about \"foreign interference activity.\" This decision followed allegations that RT and its employees funneled $10 million through shell companies to secretly fund influence campaigns on various social media channels. Meta\\'s actions were part of a broader effort to counter Russian covert influence operations, which had intensified since the invasion.[96]\\n\\nAt its 2024 Connect conference, Meta presented Orion,[97] its first pair of augmented reality glasses. Though Orion was originally intended to be sold to consumers, the manufacturing process turned out to be too complex and expensive.[98] Instead, the company pivoted to producing a small number of the glasses to be used internally.[99]\\n\\nOn 4 October 2024, Meta announced about its new AI model called Movie Gen, capable of generating realistic video and audio clips based on user prompts. Meta stated it would not release Movie Gen for open development, preferring to collaborate directly with content creators and integrate it into its products by the following year. The model was built using a combination of licensed and publicly available datasets.[100]\\n\\nOn October 31, 2024, ProPublica published an investigation into deceptive political advertisement scams that sometimes use hundreds of hijacked profiles and facebook pages run by organized networks of scammers. The authors cited spotty enforcement by Meta as a major reason for the extent of the issue.[101]\\n\\nIn November 2024, TechCrunch reported that Meta were considering building a $10bn global underwater cable spanning 25,000 miles.[102]\\n\\nIn the same month, Meta closed down 2 million accounts on Facebook and Instagram that were linked to scam centers in Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia, the Philippines, and the United Arab Emirates doing pig butchering scams.[103]\\n\\nIn December 2024, Meta announced that, beginning February 2025, they would require advertisers to run ads about financial services in Australia to verify information about who are the beneficiary and the payer in a bid to regulate scams.[104]\\n\\nOn December 4, 2024, Meta announced it will invest US$10 billion for its largest AI data center in northeast Louisiana, powered by natural gas facilities.[105]\\n\\nOn the 11th of that month, Meta experienced a global outage, impacting accounts on all of their social media and messaging applications. Outage reports from DownDetector reached 70,000+ and 100,000+ within minutes for Instagram and Facebook, respectively.[106]\\n\\nIn January 2025, Meta announced plans to roll back its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, citing shifts in the \"legal and policy landscape\" in the United States following the 2024 presidential election. The decision followed reports that CEO Mark Zuckerberg sought to align the company more closely with the incoming Trump administration, including changes to content moderation policies and executive leadership.[107] The new content moderation policies continued to bar insults about a person\\'s intellect or mental illness, but made an exception to allow calling LGBTQ people mentally ill because they are gay or transgender.[108] Later that month, Meta agreed to pay $25 million to settle a 2021 lawsuit brought by Donald Trump for suspending his social media accounts after the January 6 riots.[109] Changes to Meta\\'s moderation policies were controversial among its oversight board, with a significant divide in opinion between the board\\'s US conservatives and its global members.[110]\\n\\nMergers and acquisitions\\n\\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of mergers and acquisitions by Meta Platforms.\\n\\nMeta has acquired multiple companies (often identified as talent acquisitions).[111] One of its first major acquisitions was in April 2012, when it acquired Instagram for approximately US$1 billion in cash and stock.[112] In October 2013, Facebook, Inc. acquired Onavo, an Israeli mobile web analytics company.[113][114] In February 2014, Facebook, Inc. announced it would buy mobile messaging company WhatsApp for US$19 billion in cash and stock.[115][116] Later that year, Facebook bought Oculus VR for $2.3 billion in cash and stock,[117] which released its first consumer virtual reality headset in 2016. In late November 2019, Facebook, Inc. announced the acquisition of the game developer Beat Games, responsible for developing one of that year\\'s most popular VR games, Beat Saber.[118] In Late 2022, after Facebook Inc rebranded to Meta Platforms Inc, Oculus was rebranded to Meta Quest.\\n\\nIn May 2020, Facebook, Inc. announced it had acquired Giphy for a reported cash price of $400 million. It will be integrated with the Instagram team.[119] However, in August 2021, UK\\'s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) stated that Facebook, Inc. might have to sell Giphy, after an investigation found that the deal between the two companies would harm competition in display advertising market.[120] Facebook, Inc. was fined $70 million by CMA for deliberately failing to report all information regarding the acquisition and the ongoing antitrust investigation.[121] In October 2022, the CMA ruled for a second time that Meta be required to divest Giphy, stating that Meta already controls half of the advertising in the UK. Meta agreed to the sale, though it stated that it disagrees with the decision itself.[122] In May 2023, Giphy was divested to Shutterstock for $53 million.[123]\\n\\nIn November 2020, Facebook, Inc. announced that it planned to purchase the customer-service platform and chatbot specialist startup Kustomer to promote companies to use their platform for business. It has been reported that Kustomer valued at slightly over $1 billion.[124] The deal was closed in February 2022 after regulatory approval.[125]\\n\\nIn September 2022, Meta acquired Lofelt, a Berlin-based haptic tech startup.[126]\\n\\nLobbying\\n\\nIn 2020, Facebook, Inc. spent $19.7 million on lobbying, hiring 79 lobbyists. In 2019, it had spent $16.7 million on lobbying and had a team of 71 lobbyists, up from $12.6 million and 51 lobbyists in 2018.[127] Facebook was the largest spender of lobbying money among the Big Tech companies in 2020.[128] The lobbying team includes top congressional aide John Branscome, who was hired in September 2021, to help the company fend off threats from Democratic lawmakers and the Biden administration.[129]\\n\\nIn December 2024, Meta donated $1 million to the inauguration fund for then-President-elect Donald Trump.[130]\\n\\nCensorship\\n\\nThis section needs expansion . You can help by making an edit request adding to it . ( October 2024 )\\n\\nFurther information: Censorship by Facebook\\n\\nIn August 2024, Mark Zuckerberg sent a letter to Jim Jordan indicating that during the COVID-19 pandemic the Biden administration repeatedly asked Meta to limit certain COVID-19 content, including humor and satire, on Facebook and Instagram.[131]\\n\\nIn 2016 Meta hired Jordana Cutler, formerly an employee at the Israeli Embassy to the United States, as its policy chief for Israel and the Jewish Diaspora. In this role, Cutler pushed for the censorship of accounts belonging to Students for Justice in Palestine chapters in the United States. Critics have said that Cutler\\'s position gives the Israeli government an undue influence over Meta policy, and that few countries have such high levels of contact with Meta policymakers.[132]\\n\\nFollowing the election of Donald Trump in 2025, various sources noted possible censorship related to the Democratic Party on Instagram and other Meta platforms.[133][134][135] In February 2025, a Meta rep flagged journalist Gil Duran\\'s article and other \"critiques of tech industry figures\" as spam or sensitive content, limiting their reach.[136]\\n\\nIn March 2025, Meta attempted to block former employee Sarah Wynn-Williams from promoting or further distributing her memoir, Careless People, that includes allegations of unaddressed sexual harassment in the workplace by senior executives. The New York Times reports that the arbitration is among Meta\\'s most forcible attempts to repudiate a former employee\\'s account of workplace dynamics.[137] Publisher Macmillan reacted to the ruling by the Emergency International Arbitral Tribunal by stating that it will ignore its provisions.[138] As of 15 March 2025[update], hardback and digital versions of Careless People were being offered for sale by major online retailers.\\n\\nDisinformation concerns\\n\\nSince its inception, Meta has been accused of being a host for fake news and misinformation.[139] In the wake of the 2016 United States presidential election, Zuckerberg began to take steps to eliminate the prevalence of fake news, as the platform had been criticized for its potential influence on the outcome of the election.[140] The company initially partnered with ABC News, the Associated Press, FactCheck.org, Snopes and PolitiFact for its fact-checking initiative;[141] as of 2018, it had over 40 fact-checking partners across the world, including The Weekly Standard.[142]\\n\\nA May 2017 review by The Guardian found that the platform\\'s fact-checking initiatives of partnering with third-party fact-checkers and publicly flagging fake news were regularly ineffective, and appeared to be having minimal impact in some cases.[143] In 2018, journalists working as fact-checkers for the company criticized the partnership, stating that it had produced minimal results and that the company had ignored their concerns.[142]\\n\\nIn 2024 Meta\\'s decision to continue to disseminate a falsified video of US president Joe Biden, even after it had been proven to be fake, attracted criticism and concern.[144][145]\\n\\nMisinformation and hate speech\\n\\nIn January 2025, Meta ended its use of third-party fact-checkers in favor of a user-run community notes system similar to the one used on X.[146][147]\\n\\nWhile Zuckerberg supported these changes, saying that the amount of censorship on the platform was excessive, the decision received criticism by fact-checking institutions, stating that the changes would make it more difficult for users to identify misinformation.[148] Meta also faced criticism for weakening its policies on hate speech that were designed to protect minorities and LGBTQ+ individuals from bullying and discrimination.[149][150][151] While moving its content review teams from California to Texas, Meta changed their hateful conduct policy to eliminate restrictions on anti-LGBT and anti-immigrant hate speech, as well as explicitly allowing users to accuse LGBT people of being mentally ill or abnormal based on their sexual orientation or gender identity.[152][153][154][155]\\n\\nIn January 2025, Meta faced significant criticism for its role in removing LGBTQ+ content from its platforms, amid its broader efforts to address anti-LGBTQ+ hate speech. The removal of LGBTQ+ themes was noted as part of the wider crackdown on content deemed to violate its community guidelines. Meta\\'s content moderation policies, which were designed to combat harmful speech and protect users from discrimination, inadvertently led to the removal or restriction of LGBTQ+ content, particularly posts highlighting LGBTQ+ identities, support, or political issues. According to reports, LGBTQ+ posts, including those that simply celebrated pride or advocated for LGBTQ+ rights, were flagged and removed for reasons that some critics argue were vague or inconsistently applied. Many LGBTQ+ activists and users on Meta\\'s platforms expressed concern that such actions stifled visibility and expression, potentially isolating LGBTQ+ individuals and communities, especially in spaces that were historically important for outreach and support.[149][151][150]\\n\\nLawsuits\\n\\nMain article: Lawsuits involving Meta Platforms\\n\\nMain article: Content moderation and working conditions\\n\\nNumerous lawsuits have been filed against the company, both when it was known as Facebook, Inc., and as Meta Platforms.\\n\\nIn March 2020, the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) sued Facebook, for significant and persistent infringements of the rule on privacy involving the Cambridge Analytica fiasco. Every violation of the Privacy Act is subject to a theoretical cumulative liability of $1.7 million. The OAIC estimated that a total of 311,127 Australians had been exposed.[156]\\n\\nOn December 8, 2020, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and 46 states (excluding Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, and South Dakota), the District of Columbia and the territory of Guam, launched Federal Trade Commission v. Facebook as an antitrust lawsuit against Facebook. The lawsuit concerns Facebook\\'s acquisition of two competitors—Instagram and WhatsApp—and the ensuing monopolistic situation. FTC alleges that Facebook holds monopolistic power in the U.S. social networking market and seeks to force the company to divest from Instagram and WhatsApp to break up the conglomerate.[157] William Kovacic, a former chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, argued the case will be difficult to win as it would require the government to create a counterfactual argument of an internet where the Facebook-WhatsApp-Instagram entity did not exist, and prove that harmed competition or consumers.[158]\\n\\nOn December 24, 2021, a court in Russia fined Meta for $27 million after the company declined to remove unspecified banned content. The fine was reportedly tied to the company\\'s annual revenue in the country.[159]\\n\\nIn May 2022, a lawsuit was filed in Kenya against Meta and its local outsourcing company Sama. Allegedly, Meta has poor working conditions in Kenya for workers moderating Facebook posts. According to the lawsuit, 260 screeners were declared redundant with confusing reasoning. The lawsuit seeks financial compensation and an order that outsourced moderators be given the same health benefits and pay scale as Meta employees.[160][161]\\n\\nIn June 2022, 8 lawsuits were filed across the U.S. over the allege that excessive exposure to platforms including Facebook and Instagram has led to attempted or actual suicides, eating disorders and sleeplessness, among other issues. The litigation follows a former Facebook employee\\'s testimony in Congress that the company refused to take responsibility. The company noted that tools have been developed for parents to keep track of their children\\'s activity on Instagram and set time limits, in addition to Meta\\'s \"Take a break\" reminders. In addition, the company is providing resources specific to eating disorders as well as developing AI to prevent children under the age of 13 signing up for Facebook or Instagram.[162]\\n\\nIn June 2022, Meta settled a lawsuit with the US Department of Justice. The lawsuit, which was filed in 2019, alleged that the company enabled housing discrimination through targeted advertising, as it allowed homeowners and landlords to run housing ads excluding people based on sex, race, religion, and other characteristics. The U.S. Department of Justice stated that this was in violation of the Fair Housing Act. Meta was handed a penalty of $115,054 and given until December 31, 2022, to shadow the algorithm tool.[163][164][165]\\n\\nIn January 2023, Meta was fined €390 million for violations of the European Union General Data Protection Regulation.[166]\\n\\nIn May 2023, the European Data Protection Board fined Meta a record €1.2 billion for breaching European Union data privacy laws by transferring personal data of Facebook users to servers in the U.S.[167]\\n\\nIn July 2024, Meta agreed to pay the state of Texas US$1.4 billion to settle a lawsuit brought by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton accusing the company of collecting users\\' biometric data without consent, setting a record for the largest privacy-related settlement ever obtained by a state attorney general.[168]\\n\\nIn October 2024, Meta Platforms faced lawsuits in Japan from 30 plaintiffs who claimed they were defrauded by fake investment ads on Facebook and Instagram, featuring false celebrity endorsements. The plaintiffs are seeking approximately 2.8 million dollars in damages.[169]\\n\\nIn April 2025, the Kenyan High Court ruled that a US$2.4 billion lawsuit in which three plaintiffs claim that Facebook inflamed civil violence in Ethiopia in 2021 could proceed.[170]\\n\\nIn April 2025, Meta was fined 200 million euros ($230 million) for breaking the Digital Markets Act, by imposing a “consent or pay” system that forces users to either allow their personal data to be used to target advertisements, or pay a subscription fee for advertising-free versions of Facebook and Instagram.[171]\\n\\nIn late April 2025, a case was filed against Meta in Ghana over the alleged psychological distress experienced by content moderators employed to take down disturbing social media content including depictions of murders, extreme violence and child sexual abuse.[172] Meta moved the moderation service to the Ghanaian capital of Accra after legal issues in the previous location Kenya. The new moderation company is Teleperformance, a multinational corporation with a history of worker\\'s rights violation.[173] Reports suggests the conditions are worse here than in the previous Kenyan location, with many workers afraid of speaking out due to fear of returning to conflict zones. Workers reported developing mental illnesses, attempted suicides, and low pay.[173]\\n\\nStructure\\n\\nManagement\\n\\nMeta\\'s key management consists of:[174][175]\\n\\nMark Zuckerberg, chairman and chief executive officer\\n\\nJavier Olivan, chief operating officer\\n\\nSir Nick Clegg, president, global affairs\\n\\nSusan Li, chief financial officer\\n\\nAndrew Bosworth, chief technology officer\\n\\nDavid Wehner, chief strategy officer\\n\\nChris Cox, chief product officer\\n\\nJennifer Newstead, chief legal officer\\n\\nAs of October 2022[update], Meta had 83,553 employees worldwide.\\n\\nBoard of directors\\n\\nAs of June 2024[update], Meta\\'s board consisted of the following directors;[176]\\n\\nMark Zuckerberg (chairman, co-founder, controlling shareholder, and chief executive officer)\\n\\nPeggy Alford (non-executive director, executive vice president, global sales, PayPal)\\n\\nMarc Andreessen (non-executive director, co-founder and general partner, Andreessen Horowitz)\\n\\nDrew Houston (non-executive director, chairman and chief executive officer, Dropbox)\\n\\nNancy Killefer (non-executive director, senior partner, McKinsey & Company)\\n\\nRobert M.

In an op-ed in The New York Times, Hughes said he was concerned that Zuckerberg had surrounded himself with a team that did not challenge him, and that it is the U.S. government\\'s job to hold him accountable and curb his \"unchecked power\".[182] He also said that \"Mark\\'s power is unprecedented and un-American.\"[183] Several U.S. politicians agreed with Hughes.[184] European Union Commissioner for Competition Margrethe Vestager stated that splitting Facebook should be done only as \"a remedy of the very last resort\", and that it would not solve Facebook\\'s underlying problems.[185]\\n\\nRevenue\\n\\nYear Revenue $ Growth\\xa0% 2004 $ 0.4 [ 186 ] — 2005 9 [ 186 ] 2150 2006 48 [ 186 ] 433 2007 153 [ 186 ] 219 2008 280 [ 187 ] 83 2009 775 [ 188 ] 177 2010 2,000 [ 189 ] 158 2011 3,711 [ 190 ] 86 2012 5,089 [ 191 ] 37 2013 7,872 [ 191 ] 55 2014 12,466 [ 192 ] 58 2015 17,928 [ 193 ] 44 2016 27,638 [ 194 ] 54 2017 40,653 [ 195 ] 47 2018 55,838 [ 196 ] 37 2019 70,697 [ 196 ] 27 2020 85,965 [ 197 ] 22 2021 117,929 [ 198 ] 37 2022 116,609 [ 199 ] -1 2023 134,902 [ 200 ] 16 2024 164,501 [ 7 ] 22\\n\\nFacebook ranked No. 34 in the 2020 Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by revenue, with almost $86 billion in revenue[201] most of it coming from advertising.[202][203] One analysis of 2017 data determined that the company earned US$20.21 per user from advertising.[204]\\n\\nAccording to New York, since its rebranding, Meta has reportedly lost $500 billion as a result of new privacy measures put in place by companies such as Apple and Google which prevents Meta from gathering users\\' data.[205][206]\\n\\nNumber of advertisers\\n\\nIn February 2015, Facebook announced it had reached two million active advertisers, with most of the gain coming from small businesses. An active advertiser was defined as an entity that had advertised on the Facebook platform in the last 28 days.[207] In March 2016, Facebook announced it had reached three million active advertisers with more than 70% from outside the United States.[208] Prices for advertising follow a variable pricing model based on auctioning ad placements, and potential engagement levels of the advertisement itself. Similar to other online advertising platforms like Google and Twitter, targeting of advertisements is one of the chief merits of digital advertising compared to traditional media. Marketing on Meta is employed through two methods based on the viewing habits, likes and shares, and purchasing data of the audience, namely targeted audiences and \"look alike\" audiences.[209]\\n\\nTax affairs\\n\\nSee also: Corporation tax in the Republic of Ireland § Multinational tax schemes, and Double Irish arrangement § Effect of Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\\n\\nThe U.S. IRS challenged the valuation Facebook used when it transferred IP from the U.S. to Facebook Ireland (now Meta Platforms Ireland) in 2010 (which Facebook Ireland then revalued higher before charging out), as it was building its double Irish tax structure.[210][211] The case is ongoing and Meta faces a potential fine of $3–5bn.[212]\\n\\nThe U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 changed Facebook\\'s global tax calculations. Meta Platforms Ireland is subject to the U.S. GILTI tax of 10.5% on global intangible profits (i.e. Irish profits). On the basis that Meta Platforms Ireland Limited is paying some tax, the effective minimum US tax for Facebook Ireland will be circa 11%. In contrast, Meta Platforms Inc. would incur a special IP tax rate of 13.125% (the FDII rate) if its Irish business relocated to the U.S. Tax relief in the U.S. (21% vs. Irish at the GILTI rate) and accelerated capital expensing, would make this effective U.S. rate around 12%.[213][214][215]\\n\\nThe insignificance of the U.S./Irish tax difference was demonstrated when Facebook moved 1.5bn non-EU accounts to the U.S. to limit exposure to GDPR.[216][217]\\n\\nFacilities\\n\\nOffices\\n\\nUsers outside of the U.S. and Canada contract with Meta\\'s Irish subsidiary, Meta Platforms Ireland Limited (formerly Facebook Ireland Limited), allowing Meta to avoid US taxes for all users in Europe, Asia, Australia, Africa and South America. Meta is making use of the Double Irish arrangement which allows it to pay 2–3% corporation tax on all international revenue.[218] In 2010, Facebook opened its fourth office, in Hyderabad, India,[219] which houses online advertising and developer support teams and provides support to users and advertisers.[220] In India, Meta is registered as Facebook India Online Services Pvt Ltd.[221] It also has support centers in Chittagong; Dublin;[clarification needed] California; Ireland; and Austin, Texas.[222][not specific enough to verify]\\n\\nFacebook opened its London headquarters in 2017 in Fitzrovia in central London. Facebook opened an office in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 2018. The offices were initially home to the \"Connectivity Lab\", a group focused on bringing Internet access to those who do not have access to the Internet.[223] In April 2019, Facebook opened its Taiwan headquarters in Taipei.[224]\\n\\nIn March 2022, Meta opened new regional headquarters in Dubai.[225]\\n\\nIn September 2023, it was reported that Meta had paid £149m to British Land to break the lease on Triton Square London office. Meta reportedly had another 18 years left on its lease on the site.[226]\\n\\nEntrance to Meta\\'s headquarters complex in Menlo Park, California\\n\\nEntrance to Meta\\'s headquarters complex in Menlo Park, California\\n\\nEntrance to Facebook\\'s previous headquarters in the Stanford Research Park, Palo Alto, California\\n\\nEntrance to Facebook\\'s previous headquarters in the Stanford Research Park, Palo Alto, California\\n\\nFacebook headquarters in 2014\\n\\nFacebook headquarters in 2014\\n\\nData centers\\n\\nAs of 2023, Facebook operated 21 data centers.[227] It committed to purchase 100% renewable energy and to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions 75% by 2020.[228] Its data center technologies include Fabric Aggregator, a distributed network system that accommodates larger regions and varied traffic patterns.[229]\\n\\nReception\\n\\nFurther information: Criticism of Facebook, Privacy concerns with Facebook, and Censorship by Facebook\\n\\nUS Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez responded in a tweet to Zuckerberg\\'s announcement about Meta, saying: \"Meta as in \\'we are a cancer to democracy metastasizing into a global surveillance and propaganda machine for boosting authoritarian regimes and destroying civil society ... for profit!\\'\"[230]\\n\\nEx-Facebook employee Frances Haugen and whistleblower behind the Facebook Papers responded to the rebranding efforts by expressing doubts about the company\\'s ability to improve while led by Mark Zuckerberg, and urged the chief executive officer to resign.[231]\\n\\nIn November 2021, a video published by Inspired by Iceland went viral, in which a Zuckerberg look-alike promoted the Icelandverse, a place of \"enhanced actual reality without silly looking headsets\".[232]\\n\\nIn a December 2021 interview, SpaceX and Tesla chief executive officer Elon Musk said he could not see a compelling use-case for the VR-driven metaverse, adding: \"I don\\'t see someone strapping a frigging screen to their face all day.\"[233]\\n\\nIn January 2022, Louise Eccles of The Sunday Times logged into the metaverse with the intention of making a video guide. She wrote:\\n\\nInitially, my experience with the Oculus went well. I attended work meetings as an avatar and tried an exercise class set in the streets of Paris. The headset enabled me to feel the thrill of carving down mountains on a snowboard and the adrenaline rush of climbing a mountain without ropes. Yet switching to the social apps, where you mingle with strangers also using VR headsets, it was at times predatory and vile.\\n\\nEccles described being sexually harassed by another user, as well as \"accents from all over the world, American, Indian, English, Australian, using racist, sexist, homophobic and transphobic language\". She also encountered users as young as 7 years old on the platform, despite Oculus headsets being intended for users over 13.[234]\\n\\nSee also\\n\\nBig Tech\\n\\nCriticism of Facebook\\n\\nFacebook–Cambridge Analytica data scandal\\n\\n2021 Facebook leak\\n\\nMeta AI\\n\\nThe Social Network\\n\\nNotes\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n^ \"Inline XBRL Viewer\".

It aims to develop \"safe and beneficial\" artificial general intelligence (AGI), which it defines as \"highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work\".[6] As a leading organization in the ongoing AI boom,[7] OpenAI is known for the GPT family of large language models, the DALL-E series of text-to-image models, and a text-to-video model named Sora.[8][9] Its release of ChatGPT in November 2022 has been credited with catalyzing widespread interest in generative AI.\\n\\nThe organization has a complex corporate structure. As of April 2025, it is led by the non-profit OpenAI, Inc.,[1] registered in Delaware, and has multiple for-profit subsidiaries including OpenAI Holdings, LLC and OpenAI Global, LLC.[10] Microsoft has invested US$13 billion in OpenAI, and is entitled to 49% of OpenAI Global, LLC\\'s profits, capped at an estimated 10x their investment.[11][12] Microsoft also provides computing resources to OpenAI through its cloud platform, Microsoft Azure.[13]\\n\\nIn 2023 and 2024, OpenAI faced multiple lawsuits for alleged copyright infringement against authors and media companies whose work was used to train some of OpenAI\\'s products. In November 2023, OpenAI\\'s board removed Sam Altman as CEO, citing a lack of confidence in him, but reinstated him five days later following a reconstruction of the board. Throughout 2024, roughly half of then-employed AI safety researchers left OpenAI, citing the company\\'s prominent role in an industry-wide problem.[14][15]\\n\\nHistory\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\n2015–2018: Non-profit beginnings\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nIn December 2015, OpenAI was founded by Sam Altman, Elon Musk, Ilya Sutskever, Greg Brockman, Trevor Blackwell, Vicki Cheung, Andrej Karpathy, Durk Kingma, John Schulman, Pamela Vagata, and Wojciech Zaremba, with Sam Altman and Elon Musk as the co-chairs. A total of $1 billion in capital was pledged by Sam Altman, Greg Brockman, Elon Musk, Reid Hoffman, Jessica Livingston, Peter Thiel, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Infosys, and YC Research.[16][17] The actual collected total amount of contributions was only $130 million until 2019.[10] According to an investigation led by TechCrunch, while YC Research never contributed any funds, Open Philanthropy contributed $30 million and another $15 million in verifiable donations were traced back to Musk.[18] OpenAI later stated that Musk\\'s contributions totaled less than $45 million.[19] The organization stated it would \"freely collaborate\" with other institutions and researchers by making its patents and research open to the public.[20][21] OpenAI was initially run from Brockman\\'s living room.[22] It was later headquartered at the Pioneer Building in the Mission District, San Francisco.[23][24]\\n\\nAccording to OpenAI\\'s charter, its founding mission is \"to ensure that artificial general intelligence (AGI)—by which we mean highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work—benefits all of humanity.\"[6]\\n\\nAccording to Wired, Brockman met with Yoshua Bengio, one of the \"founding fathers\" of deep learning, and drew up a list of the \"best researchers in the field\".[25] Brockman was able to hire nine of them as the first employees in December 2015.[25] In 2016, OpenAI paid corporate-level (rather than nonprofit-level) salaries, but did not pay AI researchers salaries comparable to those of Facebook or Google.[25]\\n\\nMicrosoft\\'s Peter Lee stated that the cost of a top AI researcher exceeds the cost of a top NFL quarterback prospect.[25] OpenAI\\'s potential and mission drew these researchers to the firm; a Google employee said he was willing to leave Google for OpenAI \"partly because of the very strong group of people and, to a very large extent, because of its mission.\"[25] Brockman stated that \"the best thing that I could imagine doing was moving humanity closer to building real AI in a safe way.\"[25] OpenAI co-founder Wojciech Zaremba stated that he turned down \"borderline crazy\" offers of two to three times his market value to join OpenAI instead.[25]\\n\\nIn April 2016, OpenAI released a public beta of \"OpenAI Gym\", its platform for reinforcement learning research.[26] Nvidia gifted its first DGX-1 supercomputer to OpenAI in August 2016 to help it train larger and more complex AI models with the capability of reducing processing time from six days to two hours.[27][28] In December 2016, OpenAI released \"Universe\", a software platform for measuring and training an AI\\'s general intelligence across the world\\'s supply of games, websites, and other applications.[29][30][31][32]\\n\\nIn 2017, OpenAI spent $7.9 million, or a quarter of its functional expenses, on cloud computing alone.[33] In comparison, DeepMind\\'s total expenses in 2017 were $442 million. In the summer of 2018, simply training OpenAI\\'s Dota 2 bots required renting 128,000 CPUs and 256 GPUs from Google for multiple weeks.\\n\\nIn 2018, Musk resigned from his Board of Directors seat, citing \"a potential future conflict [of interest]\" with his role as CEO of Tesla due to Tesla\\'s AI development for self-driving cars.[34] Sam Altman claims that Musk believed that OpenAI had fallen behind other players like Google and Musk proposed instead to take over OpenAI himself, which the board rejected. Musk subsequently left OpenAI.\\n\\nIn February 2019, GPT-2 was announced, which gained attention for its ability to generate human-like text.[35]\\n\\n2019: Transition from non-profit\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nIn 2019, OpenAI transitioned from non-profit to \"capped\" for-profit, with the profit being capped at 100 times any investment.[36] According to OpenAI, the capped-profit model allows OpenAI Global, LLC to legally attract investment from venture funds and, in addition, to grant employees stakes in the company.[37] Many top researchers work for Google Brain, DeepMind, or Facebook, which offer stock options that a nonprofit would be unable to.[38] Before the transition, public disclosure of the compensation of top employees at OpenAI was legally required.[39]\\n\\nThe company then distributed equity to its employees and partnered with Microsoft,[40] announcing an investment package of $1 billion into the company. Since then, OpenAI systems have run on an Azure-based supercomputing platform from Microsoft.[41][42][43]\\n\\nOpenAI Global, LLC then announced its intention to commercially license its technologies.[44] It planned to spend the $1 billion \"within five years, and possibly much faster\".[45] Altman has stated that even a billion dollars may turn out to be insufficient, and that the lab may ultimately need \"more capital than any non-profit has ever raised\" to achieve artificial general intelligence.[46]\\n\\nThe transition from a nonprofit to a capped-profit company was viewed with skepticism by Oren Etzioni of the nonprofit Allen Institute for AI, who agreed that wooing top researchers to a nonprofit is difficult, but stated \"I disagree with the notion that a nonprofit can\\'t compete\" and pointed to successful low-budget projects by OpenAI and others. \"If bigger and better funded was always better, then IBM would still be number one.\"\\n\\nThe nonprofit, OpenAI, Inc., is the sole controlling shareholder of OpenAI Global, LLC, which, despite being a for-profit company, retains a formal fiduciary responsibility to OpenAI, Inc.\\'s nonprofit charter. A majority of OpenAI, Inc.\\'s board is barred from having financial stakes in OpenAI Global, LLC.[37] In addition, minority members with a stake in OpenAI Global, LLC are barred from certain votes due to conflict of interest.[38] Some researchers have argued that OpenAI Global, LLC\\'s switch to for-profit status is inconsistent with OpenAI\\'s claims to be \"democratizing\" AI.[47]\\n\\n2020–2023: ChatGPT, DALL-E, partnership with Microsoft\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nIn 2020, OpenAI announced GPT-3, a language model trained on large internet datasets. GPT-3 is aimed at natural language answering questions, but it can also translate between languages and coherently generate improvised text. It also announced that an associated API, named simply \"the API\", would form the heart of its first commercial product.[48]\\n\\nEleven employees left OpenAI, mostly between December 2020 and January 2021, in order to establish Anthropic.[49]\\n\\nIn 2021, OpenAI introduced DALL-E, a specialized deep learning model adept at generating complex digital images from textual descriptions, utilizing a variant of the GPT-3 architecture.[50]\\n\\nIn December 2022, OpenAI received widespread media coverage after launching a free preview of ChatGPT, its new AI chatbot based on GPT-3.5. According to OpenAI, the preview received over a million signups within the first five days.[52] According to anonymous sources cited by Reuters in December 2022, OpenAI Global, LLC was projecting $200 million of revenue in 2023 and $1 billion in revenue in 2024.[53]\\n\\nIn January 2023, OpenAI Global, LLC was in talks for funding that would value the company at $29 billion, double its 2021 value.[54] On January 23, 2023, Microsoft announced a new US$10 billion investment in OpenAI Global, LLC over multiple years, partially needed to use Microsoft\\'s cloud-computing service Azure.[55][56] Rumors of this deal suggested that Microsoft may receive 75% of OpenAI\\'s profits until it secures its investment return and a 49% stake in the company.[57] The investment is believed to be a part of Microsoft\\'s efforts to integrate OpenAI\\'s ChatGPT into the Bing search engine. Google announced a similar AI application (Bard), after ChatGPT was launched, fearing that ChatGPT could threaten Google\\'s place as a go-to source for information.[58][59]\\n\\nOn February 7, 2023, Microsoft announced that it was building AI technology based on the same foundation as ChatGPT into Microsoft Bing, Edge, Microsoft 365 and other products.[60]\\n\\nOn March 3, 2023, Reid Hoffman resigned from his board seat, citing a desire to avoid conflicts of interest with his investments in AI companies via Greylock Partners, and his co-founding of the AI startup Inflection AI. Hoffman remained on the board of Microsoft, a major investor in OpenAI.[61]\\n\\nOn March 14, 2023, OpenAI released GPT-4, both as an API (with a waitlist) and as a feature of ChatGPT Plus.[62]\\n\\nOn May 22, 2023, Sam Altman, Greg Brockman and Ilya Sutskever posted recommendations for the governance of superintelligence.[63] They consider that superintelligence could happen within the next 10 years, allowing a \"dramatically more prosperous future\" and that \"given the possibility of existential risk, we can\\'t just be reactive\". They propose creating an international watchdog organization similar to IAEA to oversee AI systems above a certain capability threshold, suggesting that relatively weak AI systems on the other side should not be overly regulated. They also call for more technical safety research for superintelligences, and ask for more coordination, for example through governments launching a joint project which \"many current efforts become part of\".[63][64]\\n\\nIn July 2023, OpenAI launched the superalignment project, aiming to find within 4 years how to align future superintelligences by automating alignment research using AI.[65]\\n\\nIn August 2023, it was announced that OpenAI had acquired the New York-based start-up Global Illumination, a company that deploys AI to develop digital infrastructure and creative tools.[66]\\n\\nOn September 21, 2023, Microsoft had begun rebranding all variants of its Copilot to Microsoft Copilot, including the former Bing Chat and the Microsoft 365 Copilot.[67] This strategy was followed in December 2023 by adding the MS-Copilot to many installations of Windows 11 and Windows 10 as well as a standalone Microsoft Copilot app released for Android[68] and one released for iOS thereafter.[69]\\n\\nIn October 2023, Sam Altman and Peng Xiao, CEO of the Emirati AI firm G42, announced Open AI would let G42 deploy Open AI technology.[70]\\n\\nOn November 6, 2023, OpenAI launched GPTs, allowing individuals to create customized versions of ChatGPT for specific purposes, further expanding the possibilities of AI applications across various industries.[71] On November 14, 2023, OpenAI announced they temporarily suspended new sign-ups for ChatGPT Plus due to high demand.[72] Access for newer subscribers re-opened a month later on December 13.[73]\\n\\n2024: Public/Non-Profit Efforts, Sora, Partnership with Apple\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nIn January 2024, OpenAI partnered with Arizona State University to provide complete access to ChatGPT Enterprise in its first educational collaboration.[74]\\n\\nIn February, amidst SEC probes and investigations into CEO Altman\\'s communications[75] OpenAI unveiled its text-to-video model Sora (text-to-video model), currently available to red teams for managing risks[76][77]\\n\\nOn February 29, 2024, Elon Musk filed a lawsuit against OpenAI and CEO Sam Altman, accusing them of shifting focus from public benefit to profit maximization—a case OpenAI dismissed as “incoherent” and “frivolous,” though Musk later revived legal action against Altman and others in August 2024.[78][79][80][81]\\n\\nIn May 2024, significant leadership changes occurred as Chief Scientist Ilya Sutskever resigned—being succeeded by Jakub Pachocki—and co-leader Jan Leike departed amid concerns over safety and trust.[82][83] That same month, OpenAI formed a partnership with Reddit to integrate its content into OpenAI products[84] and inked content deals with News Corp, along with licensing arrangements involving publishers such as Axios and Vox Media.[85]\\n\\nIn June 2024, OpenAI joined forces with Apple Inc. to integrate ChatGPT features into Apple Intelligence and iPhone[86] and added former NSA head Paul Nakasone to its board,[87] while acquiring Multi, a startup focused on remote collaboration.[88]\\n\\nIn July 2024, Reuters reported that OpenAI was developing a project, codenamed ‘Strawberry’, to enhance AI reasoning—a project later released in September as the o1 model.[89][90]\\n\\nIn August 2024, cofounder John Schulman left to join rival startup Anthropic, and OpenAI’s president Greg Brockman took extended leave until November.[91]\\n\\nIn September 2024, OpenAI’s global affairs chief endorsed the UK\\'s “smart” AI regulation during testimony to a House of Lords committee,[92] Meanwhile, CTO Mira Murati announced her departure amid internal concerns.[93][94]\\n\\nIn October 2024, OpenAI secured $6.6 billion in funding—valuing it at $157 billion—with major investors including Microsoft, Nvidia, and SoftBank,[95] It also acquired the domain Chat.com,[96][97] and saw the return of Greg Brockman after his brief absence.[98]\\n\\nIn December 2024, during the \"12 Days of OpenAI\" event, the company launched the Sora model for ChatGPT Plus and Pro users,[99][100] It also launched the advanced OpenAI o1 reasoning model[101][102] Additionally, ChatGPT Pro—a $200/month subscription service offering unlimited o1 access and enhanced voice features—was introduced, and preliminary benchmark results for the upcoming OpenAI o3 models were shared.[103]\\n\\n2025\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nOn January 20, 2025, DeepSeek released the \"DeepSeek-R1\" model, which rivaled the performance of OpenAI\\'s o1 and was open-weight.[104] DeepSeek claimed that this model only took $5.6 million to train. This news led to panic from investors and caused Nvidia to record the biggest single day market cap loss in history losing $589 billion on January 27.[105]\\n\\nOn January 21, 2025, it was announced that OpenAI, Oracle, SoftBank and MGX would launch The Stargate Project, a joint venture to build an AI infrastructure system in conjunction with the US government. The project takes its name from OpenAI\\'s existing \"Stargate\" supercomputer project and is estimated to cost $500 billion. The project will be funded over the next four years.[106]\\n\\nOn January 23, OpenAI released Operator, an AI agent and web automation tool for accessing websites to execute goals defined by users. The feature was only available to Pro users in the United States.[107][108]\\n\\nOn February 2, OpenAI made a deep research agent, that achieved an accuracy of 26.6 percent on Humanity\\'s Last Exam (HLE) benchmark, available to $200-monthly-fee paying users with up to 100 queries per month, while more “limited access” was promised for Plus, Team and later Enterprise users.[109]\\n\\nIn February, OpenAI underwent a rebranding with a new typeface, word mark, symbol and palette.[110] OpenAI began collaborating with Broadcom in 2024 to design a custom AI chip capable of both training and inference targeted for mass production in 2026 and to be manufactured by TSMC in 3 nm node. This initiative is intended to reduce OpenAI\\'s dependence on Nvidia GPUs, which are costly and face high demand in the market. [111]\\n\\nOn February 13, Sam Altman announced that GPT-4.5, internally known as \"Orion\", will be the last model without full chain-of-thought reasoning. Altman also indicated that GPT-5, expected to be released within months, could unify the O-Series and GPT-Series models, eliminating the need to choose between them and phasing out O-series models.[112][113]\\n\\nIn March 2025, OpenAI signed an $11.9 billion agreement with CoreWeave, an Nvidia-backed, AI-focused cloud service provider. As part of the deal, OpenAI will receive $350 million worth of CoreWeave shares and gain access to its AI infrastructure, which includes over a quarter million NVIDIA GPUs.[114]\\n\\nIn April 2025, OpenAI raised $40 billion at a $300 billion post-money valuation, marking the largest private technology deal on record. The financing round was led by SoftBank, with other participants including Microsoft, Coatue, Altimeter, and Thrive.[115][116]\\n\\nOn April 9, 2025, OpenAI countersued Musk in federal court, alleging that he had engaged in \"bad-faith tactics\" to slow the company’s progress and seize its innovations for his personal benefit. OpenAI also argued that Musk had previously supported the creation of a for-profit structure and had expressed interest in controlling OpenAI himself. The countersuit seeks damages and legal measures to prevent further alleged interference.[117]\\n\\nManagement\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nKey employees\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nCEO and co-founder: Sam Altman, former president of the startup accelerator Y Combinator\\n\\nPresident and co-founder: Greg Brockman, former CTO, 3rd employee of Stripe[118]\\n\\nChief Scientist Officer: Jakub Pachocki, former Director of Research at OpenAI[82]\\n\\nChief Operating Officer: Brad Lightcap, previously at Y Combinator and JPMorgan Chase[119]\\n\\nChief Financial Officer: Sarah Friar, former Nextdoor CEO and former CFO at Block, Inc.[120]\\n\\nChief Product Officer: Kevin Weil, previously at Twitter, Inc. and Meta Platforms[120]\\n\\nChief Research Officer: Mark Chen, former SVP of Research at OpenAI[121]\\n\\nChief Compliance Officer: Scott Schools, former Chief Compliance Officer of Uber\\n\\nBoard of directors of the OpenAI nonprofit\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nBret Taylor (chairman), former chairman of Twitter\\'s board of directors and co-CEO of Salesforce\\n\\nSam Altman\\n\\nLawrence Summers, former U.S. Secretary of the Treasury and President of Harvard University\\n\\nAdam D\\'Angelo, co-founder and CEO of Quora\\n\\nSue Desmond-Hellmann, former CEO of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation\\n\\nNicole Seligman, attorney and former executive vice president of the Sony Corporation\\n\\nFidji Simo, CEO and chair of Instacart\\n\\nPaul Nakasone, former Director of the National Security Agency (2018–2024)[122]\\n\\nZico Kolter, computer scientist[123]\\n\\nAdebayo Ogunlesi, managing partner at Global Infrastructure Partners[124]\\n\\nSources:[10][125]\\n\\nPrincipal individual investors\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nSource:[118]\\n\\nReid Hoffman, LinkedIn co-founder[126]\\n\\nPeter Thiel, PayPal co-founder[126]\\n\\nJessica Livingston, a founding partner of Y Combinator\\n\\nElon Musk, co-founder\\n\\nInitial motivations\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nSome scientists, such as Stephen Hawking and Stuart Russell, have articulated concerns that if advanced AI gains the ability to redesign itself at an ever-increasing rate, an unstoppable \"intelligence explosion\" could lead to human extinction. Co-founder Musk characterizes AI as humanity\\'s \"biggest existential threat\".[127]\\n\\nMusk and Altman have stated they are partly motivated by concerns about AI safety and the existential risk from artificial general intelligence.[128][129] OpenAI states that \"it\\'s hard to fathom how much human-level AI could benefit society,\" and that it is equally difficult to comprehend \"how much it could damage society if built or used incorrectly\".[21] Research on safety cannot safely be postponed: \"because of AI\\'s surprising history, it\\'s hard to predict when human-level AI might come within reach.\"[130] OpenAI states that AI \"should be an extension of individual human wills and, in the spirit of liberty, as broadly and evenly distributed as possible.\"[21] Co-chair Sam Altman expects the decades-long project to surpass human intelligence.[131]\\n\\nVishal Sikka, former CEO of Infosys, stated that an \"openness\", where the endeavor would \"produce results generally in the greater interest of humanity\", was a fundamental requirement for his support; and that OpenAI \"aligns very nicely with our long-held values\" and their \"endeavor to do purposeful work\".[132] Cade Metz of Wired suggested that corporations such as Amazon might be motivated by a desire to use open-source software and data to level the playing field against corporations such as Google and Facebook, which own enormous supplies of proprietary data. Altman stated that Y Combinator companies would share their data with OpenAI.[131]\\n\\nStrategy\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nIn the early years before his 2018 departure, Musk posed the question: \"What is the best thing we can do to ensure the future is good? We could sit on the sidelines or we can encourage regulatory oversight, or we could participate with the right structure with people who care deeply about developing AI in a way that is safe and is beneficial to humanity.\" He acknowledged that \"there is always some risk that in actually trying to advance (friendly) AI we may create the thing we are concerned about\"; but nonetheless, that the best defense was \"to empower as many people as possible to have AI. If everyone has AI powers, then there\\'s not any one person or a small set of individuals who can have AI superpower.\"[118]\\n\\nMusk and Altman\\'s counterintuitive strategy—that of trying to reduce the potential harm of AI by giving everyone access to it—is controversial among those concerned with existential risk from AI. Philosopher Nick Bostrom said, \"If you have a button that could do bad things to the world, you don\\'t want to give it to everyone.\"[129] During a 2016 conversation about technological singularity, Altman said, \"We don\\'t plan to release all of our source code\" and mentioned a plan to \"allow wide swaths of the world to elect representatives to a new governance board\". Greg Brockman stated, \"Our goal right now ... is to do the best thing there is to do. It\\'s a little vague.\"[133]\\n\\nConversely, OpenAI\\'s initial decision to withhold GPT-2 around 2019, due to a wish to \"err on the side of caution\" in the presence of potential misuse, was criticized by advocates of openness. Delip Rao, an expert in text generation, stated, \"I don\\'t think [OpenAI] spent enough time proving [GPT-2] was actually dangerous.\" Other critics argued that open publication was necessary to replicate the research and to create countermeasures.[134]\\n\\nMore recently, in 2022, OpenAI published its approach to the alignment problem, anticipating that aligning AGI to human values would likely be harder than aligning current AI systems: \"Unaligned AGI could pose substantial risks to humanity[,] and solving the AGI alignment problem could be so difficult that it will require all of humanity to work together\". They stated that they intended to explore how to better use human feedback to train AI systems, and how to safely use AI to incrementally automate alignment research.[135]\\n\\nIn 2024, following the temporary removal of Sam Altman and his return, many employees gradually left OpenAI, including most of the original leadership team and a significant number of AI safety researchers.[136][137] OpenAI also planned a restructuring to operate as a for-profit company. This restructuring could grant Altman a stake in the company.[138]\\n\\nStance on China\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nIn February 2025, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman stated that the company is interested in collaborating with the People\\'s Republic of China, despite regulatory restrictions imposed by the U.S. government.[139] This shift comes in response to the growing influence of the Chinese artificial intelligence company DeepSeek, which has disrupted the AI market with advanced models, including DeepSeek V3 and DeepSeek R1, known for their efficiency and cost-effectiveness.[140]\\n\\nThe emergence of DeepSeek has led major Chinese tech firms such as Baidu and others to embrace an open-source strategy, intensifying competition with OpenAI. Altman acknowledged the uncertainty regarding U.S. government approval for AI cooperation with China but emphasized the importance of fostering dialogue between technological leaders in both nations.[141]\\n\\nProducts and applications\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nReinforcement learning\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nAt its beginning, OpenAI\\'s research included many projects focused on reinforcement learning (RL).[142] OpenAI has been viewed as an important competitor to DeepMind.[143]\\n\\nGym\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nAnnounced in 2016, Gym was an open-source Python library designed to facilitate the development of reinforcement learning algorithms. It aimed to standardize how environments are defined in AI research, making published research more easily reproducible[26][144] while providing users with a simple interface for interacting with these environments. In 2022, new developments of Gym have been moved to the library Gymnasium.[145][146]\\n\\nGym Retro\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nReleased in 2018, Gym Retro is a platform for reinforcement learning (RL) research on video games[147] using RL algorithms and study generalization. Prior RL research focused mainly on optimizing agents to solve single tasks. Gym Retro gives the ability to generalize between games with similar concepts but different appearances.\\n\\nRoboSumo\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nReleased in 2017, RoboSumo is a virtual world where humanoid metalearning robot agents initially lack knowledge of how to even walk, but are given the goals of learning to move and to push the opposing agent out of the ring.[148] Through this adversarial learning process, the agents learn how to adapt to changing conditions. When an agent is then removed from this virtual environment and placed in a new virtual environment with high winds, the agent braces to remain upright, suggesting it had learned how to balance in a generalized way.[148][149] OpenAI\\'s Igor Mordatch argued that competition between agents could create an intelligence \"arms race\" that could increase an agent\\'s ability to function even outside the context of the competition.[148]\\n\\nOpenAI Five\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nMain article: OpenAI Five\\n\\nOpenAI Five is a team of five OpenAI-curated bots used in the competitive five-on-five video game Dota 2, that learn to play against human players at a high skill level entirely through trial-and-error algorithms. Before becoming a team of five, the first public demonstration occurred at The International 2017, the annual premiere championship tournament for the game, where Dendi, a professional Ukrainian player, lost against a bot in a live one-on-one matchup.[150][151] After the match, CTO Greg Brockman explained that the bot had learned by playing against itself for two weeks of real time, and that the learning software was a step in the direction of creating software that can handle complex tasks like a surgeon.[152][153] The system uses a form of reinforcement learning, as the bots learn over time by playing against themselves hundreds of times a day for months, and are rewarded for actions such as killing an enemy and taking map objectives.[154][155][156]\\n\\nBy June 2018, the ability of the bots expanded to play together as a full team of five, and they were able to defeat teams of amateur and semi-professional players.[157][154][158][159] At The International 2018, OpenAI Five played in two exhibition matches against professional players, but ended up losing both games.[160][161][162] In April 2019, OpenAI Five defeated OG, the reigning world champions of the game at the time, 2:0 in a live exhibition match in San Francisco.[163][164] The bots\\' final public appearance came later that month, where they played in 42,729 total games in a four-day open online competition, winning 99.4% of those games.[165]\\n\\nOpenAI Five\\'s mechanisms in Dota 2\\'s bot player shows the challenges of AI systems in multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) games and how OpenAI Five has demonstrated the use of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents to achieve superhuman competence in Dota 2 matches.[166]\\n\\nDactyl\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nDeveloped in 2018, Dactyl uses machine learning to train a Shadow Hand, a human-like robot hand, to manipulate physical objects.[167] It learns entirely in simulation using the same RL algorithms and training code as OpenAI Five. OpenAI tackled the object orientation problem by using domain randomization, a simulation approach which exposes the learner to a variety of experiences rather than trying to fit to reality. The set-up for Dactyl, aside from having motion tracking cameras, also has RGB cameras to allow the robot to manipulate an arbitrary object by seeing it. In 2018, OpenAI showed that the system was able to manipulate a cube and an octagonal prism.[168]\\n\\nIn 2019, OpenAI demonstrated that Dactyl could solve a Rubik\\'s Cube. The robot was able to solve the puzzle 60% of the time. Objects like the Rubik\\'s Cube introduce complex physics that is harder to model. OpenAI did this by improving the robustness of Dactyl to perturbations by using Automatic Domain Randomization (ADR), a simulation approach of generating progressively more difficult environments. ADR differs from manual domain randomization by not needing a human to specify randomization ranges.[169]\\n\\nAPI\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nIn June 2020, OpenAI announced a multi-purpose API which it said was \"for accessing new AI models developed by OpenAI\" to let developers call on it for \"any English language AI task\".[170][171]\\n\\nText generation\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nThe company has popularized generative pretrained transformers (GPT).[172]\\n\\nOpenAI\\'s original GPT model (\"GPT-1\")\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nFurther information: Generative pre-trained transformer § History\\n\\nThe original paper on generative pre-training of a transformer-based language model was written by Alec Radford and his colleagues, and published in preprint on OpenAI\\'s website on June 11, 2018.[173] It showed how a generative model of language could acquire world knowledge and process long-range dependencies by pre-training on a diverse corpus with long stretches of contiguous text.\\n\\nGPT-2\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nMain article: GPT-2\\n\\nGenerative Pre-trained Transformer 2 (\"GPT-2\") is an unsupervised transformer language model and the successor to OpenAI\\'s original GPT model (\"GPT-1\"). GPT-2 was announced in February 2019, with only limited demonstrative versions initially released to the public. The full version of GPT-2 was not immediately released due to concern about potential misuse, including applications for writing fake news.[174] Some experts expressed skepticism that GPT-2 posed a significant threat.\\n\\nIn response to GPT-2, the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence responded with a tool to detect \"neural fake news\".[175] Other researchers, such as Jeremy Howard, warned of \"the technology to totally fill Twitter, email, and the web up with reasonable-sounding, context-appropriate prose, which would drown out all other speech and be impossible to filter\".[176] In November 2019, OpenAI released the complete version of the GPT-2 language model.[177] Several websites host interactive demonstrations of different instances of GPT-2 and other transformer models.[178][179][180]\\n\\nGPT-2\\'s authors argue unsupervised language models to be general-purpose learners, illustrated by GPT-2 achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and perplexity on 7 of 8 zero-shot tasks (i.e. the model was not further trained on any task-specific input-output examples).\\n\\nThe corpus it was trained on, called WebText, contains slightly 40 gigabytes of text from URLs shared in Reddit submissions with at least 3 upvotes. It avoids certain issues encoding vocabulary with word tokens by using byte pair encoding. This permits representing any string of characters by encoding both individual characters and multiple-character tokens.[181]\\n\\nGPT-3\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nMain article: GPT-3\\n\\nFirst described in May 2020, Generative Pre-trained[a] Transformer 3 (GPT-3) is an unsupervised transformer language model and the successor to GPT-2.[182][183][184] OpenAI stated that the full version of GPT-3 contained 175 billion parameters,[184] two orders of magnitude larger than the 1.5 billion[185] in the full version of GPT-2 (although GPT-3 models with as few as 125 million parameters were also trained).[186]\\n\\nOpenAI stated that GPT-3 succeeded at certain \"meta-learning\" tasks and could generalize the purpose of a single input-output pair. The GPT-3 release paper gave examples of translation and cross-linguistic transfer learning between English and Romanian, and between English and German.[184]\\n\\nGPT-3 dramatically improved benchmark results over GPT-2. OpenAI cautioned that such scaling-up of language models could be approaching or encountering the fundamental capability limitations of predictive language models.[187] Pre-training GPT-3 required several thousand petaflop/s-days[b] of compute, compared to tens of petaflop/s-days for the full GPT-2 model.[184] Like its predecessor,[174] the GPT-3 trained model was not immediately released to the public for concerns of possible abuse, although OpenAI planned to allow access through a paid cloud API after a two-month free private beta that began in June 2020.[170][189]\\n\\nOn September 23, 2020, GPT-3 was licensed exclusively to Microsoft.[190][191]\\n\\nCodex\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nMain article: OpenAI Codex\\n\\nAnnounced in mid-2021, Codex is a descendant of GPT-3 that has additionally been trained on code from 54 million GitHub repositories,[192][193] and is the AI powering the code autocompletion tool GitHub Copilot.[193] In August 2021, an API was released in private beta.[194] According to OpenAI, the model can create working code in over a dozen programming languages, most effectively in Python.[192]\\n\\nSeveral issues with glitches, design flaws and security vulnerabilities were cited.[195][196]\\n\\nOpenAI announced that they would discontinue support for Codex API on March 23, 2023.[197]\\n\\nGPT-4\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nMain article: GPT-4\\n\\nOn March 14, 2023, OpenAI announced the release of Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 (GPT-4), capable of accepting text or image inputs.[198] They announced that the updated technology passed a simulated law school bar exam with a score around the top 10% of test takers. (By contrast, GPT-3.5 scored around the bottom 10%.) They said that GPT-4 could also read, analyze or generate up to 25,000 words of text, and write code in all major programming languages.[199]\\n\\nObservers reported that the iteration of ChatGPT using GPT-4 was an improvement on the previous GPT-3.5-based iteration, with the caveat that GPT-4 retained some of the problems with earlier revisions.[200] GPT-4 is also capable of taking images as input on ChatGPT.[201] OpenAI has declined to reveal various technical details and statistics about GPT-4, such as the precise size of the model.[202]\\n\\nGPT-4o\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nOn May 13, 2024, OpenAI announced and released GPT-4o, which can process and generate text, images and audio.[203] GPT-4o achieved state-of-the-art results in voice, multilingual, and vision benchmarks, setting new records in audio speech recognition and translation.[204][205] It scored 88.7% on the Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) benchmark compared to 86.5% by GPT-4.[206]\\n\\nOn July 18, 2024, OpenAI released GPT-4o mini, a smaller version of GPT-4o replacing GPT-3.5 Turbo on the ChatGPT interface. Its API costs $0.15 per million input tokens and $0.60 per million output tokens, compared to $5 and $15 respectively for GPT-4o. OpenAI expects it to be particularly useful for enterprises, startups and developers seeking to automate services with AI agents.[207]\\n\\nIn March 2025, OpenAI released GPT-4o\\'s native image generation feature, as an alternative to DALL-E 3. [208]\\n\\nGPT-4.5\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nOn February 27, 2025, OpenAI released GPT-4.5, codenamed Orion. Sam Altman claimed that GPT-4.5 would present inaccurate information less frequently than previous models, and described it as a \"giant, expensive model\".[209]\\n\\nGPT-4.1\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nOn April 14, 2025, OpenAI released the GPT-4.1 model. They also released two “smaller, faster, and cheaper” models including GPT-4.1 mini and GPT-4.1 nano.[210][211][212]\\n\\no1\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nMain article: OpenAI o1\\n\\nOn September 12, 2024, OpenAI released the o1-preview and o1-mini models, which have been designed to take more time to think about their responses, leading to higher accuracy. These models are particularly effective in science, coding, and reasoning tasks, and were made available to ChatGPT Plus and Team members.[213][214] In December 2024, o1-preview was replaced by o1.[215] In March 2025, the o1-Pro model was made available through OpenAI\\'s developer API, which was previously available to ChatGPT Pro users since December 2024. The pricing is $150 per million input tokens and $600 per million output tokens.[216]\\n\\no3\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nMain article: OpenAI o3\\n\\nOn December 20, 2024, OpenAI unveiled o3, the successor of the o1 reasoning model. OpenAI also unveiled o3-mini, a lighter and faster version of OpenAI o3. As of December 21, 2024, this model is not available for public use. According to OpenAI, they are testing o3 and o3-mini.[217][218] Until January 10, 2025, safety and security researchers had the opportunity to apply for early access to these models.[219] The model is called o3 rather than o2 to avoid confusion with telecommunications services provider O2.[220] On April 2025, OpenAI released o3 to all the paid users. o3 has enhance reasoning and problem-solving capabilities than o1.[221]\\n\\nDeep research\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nMain article: ChatGPT Deep Research\\n\\nDeep research is an agent developed by OpenAI, unveiled on February 2, 2025. It leverages the capabilities of OpenAI\\'s o3 model to perform extensive web browsing, data analysis, and synthesis, delivering comprehensive reports within a timeframe of 5 to 30 minutes.[222] With browsing and Python tools enabled, it reached an accuracy of 26.6 percent on HLE (Humanity\\'s Last Exam) benchmark.[109] In April 2025, OpenAI started rolling out a lightweight version of Deep Research to all its ChatGPT free users.[223][224]\\n\\nImage classification\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nCLIP\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nRevealed in 2021, CLIP (Contrastive Language–Image Pre-training) is a model that is trained to analyze the semantic similarity between text and images. It can notably be used for image classification.[225]\\n\\nText-to-image\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nMain article: DALL-E\\n\\nDALL-E\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nRevealed in 2021, DALL-E is a Transformer model that creates images from textual descriptions.[226] DALL-E uses a 12-billion-parameter version of GPT-3 to interpret natural language inputs (such as \"a green leather purse shaped like a pentagon\" or \"an isometric view of a sad capybara\") and generate corresponding images. It can create images of realistic objects (\"a stained-glass window with an image of a blue strawberry\") as well as objects that do not exist in reality (\"a cube with the texture of a porcupine\"). As of March 2021, no API or code is available.\\n\\nDALL-E 2\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nIn April 2022, OpenAI announced DALL-E 2, an updated version of the model with more realistic results.[227] In December 2022, OpenAI published on GitHub software for Point-E, a new rudimentary system for converting a text description into a 3-dimensional model.[228]\\n\\nDALL-E 3\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nIn September 2023, OpenAI announced DALL-E 3, a more powerful model better able to generate images from complex descriptions without manual prompt engineering and render complex details like hands and text.[229] It was released to the public as a ChatGPT Plus feature in October.[230]\\n\\nText-to-video\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nSora\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nMain article: Sora (text-to-video model)\\n\\nSora is a text-to-video model that can generate videos based on short descriptive prompts[231] as well as extend existing videos forwards or backwards in time.[232] It can generate videos with resolution up to 1920x1080 or 1080x1920. The maximal length of generated videos is unknown.\\n\\nSora\\'s development team named it after the Japanese word for \"sky\", to signify its \"limitless creative potential\".[231] Sora\\'s technology is an adaptation of the technology behind the DALL·E 3 text-to-image model.[233] OpenAI trained the system using publicly-available videos as well as copyrighted videos licensed for that purpose, but did not reveal the number or the exact sources of the videos.[231]\\n\\nOpenAI demonstrated some Sora-created high-definition videos to the public on February 15, 2024, stating that it could generate videos up to one minute long. It also shared a technical report highlighting the methods used to train the model, and the model\\'s capabilities.[233] It acknowledged some of its shortcomings, including struggles simulating complex physics.[234] Will Douglas Heaven of the MIT Technology Review called the demonstration videos \"impressive\", but noted that they must have been cherry-picked and might not represent Sora\\'s typical output.[233]\\n\\nDespite skepticism from some academic leaders following Sora\\'s public demo, notable entertainment-industry figures have shown significant interest in the technology\\'s potential. In an interview, actor/filmmaker Tyler Perry expressed his astonishment at the technology\\'s ability to generate realistic video from text descriptions, citing its potential to revolutionize storytelling and content creation. He said that his excitement about Sora\\'s possibilities was so strong that he had decided to pause plans for expanding his Atlanta-based movie studio.[235]\\n\\nSpeech-to-text\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nWhisper\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nMain article: Whisper (speech recognition system)\\n\\nReleased in 2022, Whisper is a general-purpose speech recognition model.[236] It is trained on a large dataset of diverse audio and is also a multi-task model that can perform multilingual speech recognition as well as speech translation and language identification.[237]\\n\\nMusic generation\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nMuseNet\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nReleased in 2019, MuseNet is a deep neural net trained to predict subsequent musical notes in MIDI music files. It can generate songs with 10 instruments in 15 styles. According to The Verge, a song generated by MuseNet tends to start reasonably but then fall into chaos the longer it plays.[238][239] In pop culture, initial applications of this tool were used as early as 2020 for the internet psychological thriller Ben Drowned to create music for the titular character.[240][241]\\n\\nJukebox\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nReleased in 2020, Jukebox is an open-sourced algorithm to generate music with vocals. After training on 1.2 million samples, the system accepts a genre, artist, and a snippet of lyrics and outputs song samples. OpenAI stated the songs \"show local musical coherence [and] follow traditional chord patterns\" but acknowledged that the songs lack \"familiar larger musical structures such as choruses that repeat\" and that \"there is a significant gap\" between Jukebox and human-generated music. The Verge stated \"It\\'s technologically impressive, even if the results sound like mushy versions of songs that might feel familiar\", while Business Insider stated \"surprisingly, some of the resulting songs are catchy and sound legitimate\".[242][243][244]\\n\\nUser interfaces\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nDebate Game\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nIn 2018, OpenAI launched the Debate Game, which teaches machines to debate toy problems in front of a human judge. The purpose is to research whether such an approach may assist in auditing AI decisions and in developing explainable AI.[245][246]\\n\\nMicroscope\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nReleased in 2020, Microscope[247] is a collection of visualizations of every significant layer and neuron of eight neural network models which are often studied in interpretability.[248] Microscope was created to analyze the features that form inside these neural networks easily. The models included are AlexNet, VGG-19, different versions of Inception, and different versions of CLIP Resnet.[249]\\n\\nChatGPT\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nMain article: ChatGPT\\n\\nLaunched in November 2022, ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence tool built on top of GPT-3 that provides a conversational interface that allows users to ask questions in natural language. The system then responds with an answer within seconds. ChatGPT reached 1 million users 5 days after its launch.[250][251]\\n\\nAs of 2023, ChatGPT Plus is a GPT-4 backed version of ChatGPT[252] available for a US$20 per month subscription fee[253] (the original version is backed by GPT-3.5).[254] OpenAI also makes GPT-4 available to a select group of applicants through their GPT-4 API waitlist;[255] after being accepted, an additional fee of US$0.03 per 1000 tokens in the initial text provided to the model (\"prompt\"), and US$0.06 per 1000 tokens that the model generates (\"completion\"), is charged for access to the version of the model with an 8192-token context window; for the 32768-token context window, the prices are doubled.[256]\\n\\nIn May 2023, OpenAI launched a user interface for ChatGPT for the App Store on iOS and later in July 2023 for the Play Store on Android.[257] The app supports chat history syncing and voice input (using Whisper, OpenAI\\'s speech recognition model).[258][257][259] In September 2023, OpenAI announced that ChatGPT \"can now see, hear, and speak\". ChatGPT Plus users can upload images, while mobile app users can talk to the chatbot.[260][261]\\n\\nIn October 2023, OpenAI\\'s latest image generation model, DALL-E 3, was integrated into ChatGPT Plus and ChatGPT Enterprise. The integration uses ChatGPT to write prompts for DALL-E guided by conversation with users.[262][263]\\n\\nOpenAI\\'s GPT Store, initially slated for a 2023 launch, is now deferred to an undisclosed date in early 2024, attributed likely to the leadership changes in November following the initial announcement.[264]\\n\\nConcerns about the energy consumption of generative AI, including ChatGPT, are rising. In September 2024, Microsoft entered a deal with Constellation Energy to reopen the Three Mile Island nuclear plant to supply power to its AI-driven data centers.[265]\\n\\nIn December 2024, OpenAI launched a new feature allowing users to call ChatGPT for up to 15 minutes per month for free.[266][267]\\n\\nSearchGPT\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nMain article: SearchGPT\\n\\nSearchGPT, a prototype search engine developed by OpenAI, was unveiled on July 25, 2024, with an initial limited release to 10,000 test users. It combines traditional search engine features with generative AI capabilities.[268][269]\\n\\nStargate and other supercomputers\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nStargate is a potential artificial intelligence supercomputer in development by Microsoft and OpenAI, in collaboration with Oracle, SoftBank, and MGX.[270][271] Stargate is designed as part of a greater data center project, which could represent an investment of as much as $100 billion by Microsoft.[272]\\n\\nStargate is reported to be part of a series of AI-related construction projects planned in the next few years by the companies Microsoft and OpenAI.[272] The supercomputers will be constructed in five phases.[270] The fourth phase should consist in a smaller OpenAI supercomputer, planned to launch around 2026.[270] Stargate is the fifth and final phase of the program, and will take five and six years to complete and is slated to launch around 2028.[272]\\n\\nThe artificial intelligence of Stargate is slated to be contained on millions of special server chips.[272] The supercomputer\\'s data center will be built in the US across 700 acres of land.[272] It has a planned power consumption of 5 gigawatts, for which it could rely on nuclear energy.[272] The name \"Stargate\" is a homage to the 1994 sci-fi film Stargate.[272]\\n\\nControversies\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nFiring of Altman\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nFurther information: Removal of Sam Altman from OpenAI\\n\\nOn November 17, 2023, Sam Altman was removed as CEO when its board of directors (composed of Helen Toner, Ilya Sutskever, Adam D\\'Angelo and Tasha McCauley) cited a lack of confidence in him. Chief Technology Officer Mira Murati took over as interim CEO. Greg Brockman, the president of OpenAI, was also removed as chairman of the board[273][274] and resigned from the company\\'s presidency shortly thereafter.[275] Three senior OpenAI researchers subsequently resigned: director of research and GPT-4 lead Jakub Pachocki, head of AI risk Aleksander Mądry [pl], and researcher Szymon Sidor.[276][277]\\n\\nOn November 18, 2023, there were reportedly talks of Altman returning as CEO amid pressure placed upon the board by investors such as Microsoft and Thrive Capital, who objected to Altman\\'s departure.[278] Although Altman himself spoke in favor of returning to OpenAI, he has since stated that he considered starting a new company and bringing former OpenAI employees with him if talks to reinstate him didn\\'t work out.[279] The board members agreed \"in principle\" to resign if Altman returned.[280] On November 19, 2023, negotiations with Altman to return failed and Murati was replaced by Emmett Shear as interim CEO.[281] The board initially contacted Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei (a former OpenAI executive) about replacing Altman, and proposed a merger of the two companies, but both offers were declined.[282]\\n\\nOn November 20, 2023, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella announced Altman and Brockman would be joining Microsoft to lead a new advanced AI research team, but added that they were still committed to OpenAI despite recent events.[283] Before the partnership with Microsoft was finalized, Altman gave the board another opportunity to negotiate with him.[284] About 738 of OpenAI\\'s 770 employees, including Murati and Sutskever, signed an open letter stating they would quit their jobs and join Microsoft if the board did not rehire Altman and then resign.[285][286] This prompted OpenAI investors to consider legal action against the board as well.[287] In response, OpenAI management sent an internal memo to employees stating that negotiations with Altman and the board had resumed and would take some time.[288]\\n\\nOn November 21, 2023, after continued negotiations, Altman and Brockman returned to the company in their prior roles along with a reconstructed board made up of new members Bret Taylor (as chairman) and Lawrence Summers, with D\\'Angelo remaining.[289] On November 22, 2023, emerging reports suggested that Sam Altman\\'s dismissal from OpenAI may have been linked to his alleged mishandling of a significant breakthrough in the organization\\'s secretive project codenamed Q*. According to sources within OpenAI, Q* is aimed at developing AI capabilities in logical and mathematical reasoning, and reportedly involves performing math on the level of grade-school students.[290][291][292] Concerns about Altman\\'s response to this development, specifically regarding the discovery\\'s potential safety implications, were reportedly raised with the company\\'s board shortly before Altman\\'s firing.[293] On November 29, 2023, OpenAI announced that an anonymous Microsoft employee had joined the board as a non-voting member to observe the company\\'s operations;[294] Microsoft resigned from the board in July 2024.[295]\\n\\nContent moderation contract with Sama\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nFor broader coverage of this topic, see Content moderation and working conditions.\\n\\nIn January 2023, OpenAI has been criticized for outsourcing the annotation of data sets to Sama, a company based in San Francisco that employed workers in Kenya. These annotations were used to train an AI model to detect toxicity, which could then be used to moderate toxic content, notably from ChatGPT\\'s training data and outputs. However, these pieces of text usually contained detailed descriptions of various types of violence, including sexual violence. The investigation uncovered that OpenAI began sending snippets of data to Sama as early as November 2021. The four Sama employees interviewed by Time described themselves as mentally scarred. OpenAI paid Sama $12.50 per hour of work, and Sama was redistributing the equivalent of between $1.32 and $2.00 per hour post-tax to its annotators. Sama\\'s spokesperson said that the $12.50 was also covering other implicit costs, among which were infrastructure expenses, quality assurance and management.[296]\\n\\nLack of technological transparency\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nIn March 2023, the company was also criticized for disclosing particularly few technical details about products like GPT-4, contradicting its initial commitment to openness and making it harder for independent researchers to replicate its work and develop safeguards. OpenAI cited competitiveness and safety concerns to justify this strategic turn. OpenAI\\'s former chief scientist Ilya Sutskever argued in 2023 that open-sourcing increasingly capable models was increasingly risky, and that the safety reasons for not open-sourcing the most potent AI models would become \"obvious\" in a few years.[297]\\n\\nNon-disparagement agreement\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nOn May 17, 2024, a Vox article reported that OpenAI was asking departing employees to sign a lifelong non-disparagement agreement forbidding them from criticizing OpenAI or acknowledging the existence of the agreement. Daniel Kokotajlo, a former employee, publicly stated that he forfeited his vested equity in OpenAI in order to leave without signing the agreement.[298][299] Sam Altman stated that he was unaware of the equity cancellation provision, and that OpenAI never enforced it to cancel any employee\\'s vested equity.[300] Vox published leaked documents and emails challenging this claim.[301] On May 23, 2024, OpenAI sent a memo releasing former employees from the agreement.[302]\\n\\nProposed shift from nonprofit control\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nOpenAI, Inc. was originally designed as a nonprofit in order to ensure that AGI \"benefits all of humanity\" rather than \"the private gain of any person\". In 2019, it created OpenAI Global, LLC, a capped-profit subsidiary controlled by the nonprofit. In December 2024, OpenAI proposed a restructuring plan to convert the capped-profit into a Delaware-based public benefit corporation (PBC), and to release it from the control of the nonprofit. The nonprofit would sell its control and other assets, getting equity in return, and would use it to fund and pursue separate charitable projects, including in science and education. OpenAI\\'s leadership described the change as necessary to secure additional investments, and claimed that the nonprofit\\'s founding mission to ensure AGI \"benefits all of humanity\" would be better fulfilled.[303]\\n\\nThe plan has been criticized by experts and former employees. A legal letter named \"Not For Private Gain\" asked the attorneys general of California and Delaware to intervene, stating that the restructuring is illegal and would remove governance safeguards from the nonprofit and the attorneys general.[304] The letter argues that OpenAI\\'s complex structure was deliberately designed to remain accountable to its mission, without the conflicting pressure of maximizing profits. It contends that the nonprofit is best positioned to advance its mission of ensuring AGI benefits all of humanity by continuing to control OpenAI Global, LLC, whatever the amount of equity that it could get in exchange.[305] PBCs can choose how they balance their mission with profit-making. Controlling shareholders have a large influence on how closely a PBC sticks to its mission.[306][305]\\n\\nLegally, under nonprofit law, assets dedicated to a charitable purpose must continue to serve that purpose. To change its purpose, OpenAI would have to prove that its current purposes have become unlawful, impossible, impracticable, or wasteful.[307] Elon Musk, who had initiated a lawsuit against OpenAI and Altman in August 2024 alleging the company violated contract provisions by prioritizing profit over its mission, reportedly leveraged this lawsuit to stop the restructuring plan.[306] On February 10, 2025, a consortium of investors led by Elon Musk submitted a $97.4 billion unsolicited bid to buy the nonprofit that controls OpenAI, declaring willingness to match or exceed any better offer.[308][309] The offer was rejected on 14 February 2025, with OpenAI stating that it was not for sale,[310] but the offer complicated Altman\\'s restructuring plan by suggesting a lower bar for how much the nonprofit should be valued.[309]\\n\\nIn May 2025, the nonprofit\\'s board chairman Bret Taylor announced that the nonprofit would renounce plans to cede control after outside pressure. The capped-profit will still transition to a PBC.[311]\\n\\nCopyright infringement in training data\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nOpenAI was sued for copyright infringement by authors Sarah Silverman, Matthew Butterick, Paul Tremblay and Mona Awad in July 2023.[312][313][314] In September 2023, 17 authors, including George R. R. Martin, John Grisham, Jodi Picoult and Jonathan Franzen, joined the Authors Guild in filing a class action lawsuit against OpenAI, alleging that the company\\'s technology was illegally using their copyrighted work.[315][316] The New York Times also sued the company in late December 2023.[313][317] In May 2024 it was revealed that OpenAI had destroyed its Books1 and Books2 training datasets, which were used in the training of GPT-3, and which the Authors Guild believed to have contained over 100,000 copyrighted books.[318]\\n\\nIn 2021, OpenAI developed a speech recognition tool called Whisper. OpenAI used it to transcribe more than one million hours of YouTube videos into text for training GPT-4. The automated transcription of YouTube videos raised concerns within OpenAI employees regarding potential violations of YouTube\\'s terms of service, which prohibit the use of videos for applications independent of the platform, as well as any type of automated access to its videos. Despite these concerns, the project proceeded with notable involvement from OpenAI\\'s president, Greg Brockman. The resulting dataset proved instrumental in training GPT-4.[319]\\n\\nIn February 2024, The Intercept as well as Raw Story and Alternate Media Inc. filed lawsuit against OpenAI on copyright litigation ground.[320][321] The lawsuit is said to have charted a new legal strategy for digital-only publishers to sue OpenAI.[322]\\n\\nOn April 30, 2024, eight newspapers filed a lawsuit in the Southern District of New York against OpenAI and Microsoft, claiming illegal harvesting of their copyrighted articles. The suing publications included The Mercury News, The Denver Post, The Orange County Register, St. Paul Pioneer Press, Chicago Tribune, Orlando Sentinel, Sun Sentinel, and New York Daily News.[323]\\n\\nGDPR compliance\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nIn April 2023, the EU\\'s European Data Protection Board (EDPB) formed a dedicated task force on ChatGPT \"to foster cooperation and to exchange information on possible enforcement actions conducted by data protection authorities\" based on the \"enforcement action undertaken by the Italian data protection authority against Open AI about the Chat GPT service\".[324]\\n\\nIn late April 2024 NOYB filed a complaint with the Austrian Datenschutzbehörde against OpenAI for violating the European General Data Protection Regulation. A text created with ChatGPT gave a false date of birth for a living person without giving the individual the option to see the personal data used in the process. A request to correct the mistake was denied. Additionally, neither the recipients of ChatGPT\\'s work nor the sources used, could be made available, OpenAI claimed.[325]\\n\\nUse by military\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nOpenAI was criticized for lifting its ban on using ChatGPT for \"military and warfare\". Up until January 10, 2024, its \"usage policies\" included a ban on \"activity that has high risk of physical harm, including,\" specifically, \"weapons development\" and \"military and warfare.\" Its new policies prohibit \"[using] our service to harm yourself or others\" and to \"develop or use weapons\".[326][327] As one of the industry collaborators, OpenAI provides LLM to the Artificial Intelligence Cyber Challenge (AIxCC) sponsored by Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health to protect software critical to Americans.[328] In October 2024, The Intercept revealed that OpenAI\\'s tools are considered \"essential\" for AFRICOM\\'s mission and included in an \"Exception to Fair Opportunity\" contractural agreement between the United States Department of Defense and Microsoft.[329] In December 2024, OpenAI said it would partner with defense-tech company Anduril to build drone defense technologies for the United States and its allies.[330]\\n\\nData scraping\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nIn June 2023, a lawsuit claimed that OpenAI scraped 300 billion words online without consent and without registering as a data broker. It was filed in San Francisco, California, by sixteen anonymous plaintiffs.[331] They also claimed that OpenAI and its partner as well as customer Microsoft continued to unlawfully collect and use personal data from millions of consumers worldwide to train artificial intelligence models.[332]\\n\\nOn May 22, 2024, OpenAI entered into an agreement with News Corp to integrate news content from The Wall Street Journal, the New York Post, The Times, and The Sunday Times into its AI platform. Meanwhile, other publications like The New York Times chose to sue OpenAI and Microsoft for copyright infringement over the use of their content to train AI models.[333] In November 2024, a coalition of Canadian news outlets, including the Toronto Star, Metroland Media, Postmedia, The Globe and Mail, The Canadian Press and CBC, sued OpenAI for using their news articles to train its software without permission.[334]\\n\\nSuicide of Suchir Balaji\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nFurther information: Suchir Balaji\\n\\nSuchir Balaji, a former researcher at OpenAI, was found dead in his San Francisco apartment on November 26, 2024. Independent investigations carried out by the San Francisco Police Department (SFPD) and the San Francisco Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME) concluded that Balaji shot himself.[335]\\n\\nThe death occurred 34 days after a New York Times interview in which he accused OpenAI of violating copyright law in developing its commercial LLMs, one of which (GPT-4) he had helped engineer. He was also a likely witness in a major copyright trial against the AI company, and was one of several of its current or former employees named in The New York Times\\'s court filings as potentially having documents relevant to the case. The death led to speculation and conspiracy theories suggesting he had been deliberately silenced.[335][336] Elon Musk, Tucker Carlson, California Congressman Ro Khanna, and San Francisco Supervisor Jackie Fielder have publicly echoed Balaji\\'s parents\\' skepticism and calls for an investigation, as of January, 2025.[337][338]\\n\\nIn February 2025, the OCME autopsy and SFPD police reports were released. A joint letter from both agencies to the parents\\' legal team noted that he had purchased the firearm used two years prior to his death, and had recently searched for brain anatomy information on his computer. The letter also highlighted that his apartment\\'s only entrance was dead-bolted from inside with no signs of forced entry.[335]\\n\\nSee also\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nAnthropic – American artificial intelligence research company\\n\\nCenter for AI Safety – US-based AI safety research center\\n\\nFuture of Humanity Institute – Defunct Oxford interdisciplinary research centre\\n\\nFuture of Life Institute – International nonprofit research institute\\n\\nGoogle DeepMind – Artificial intelligence research laboratory\\n\\nMachine Intelligence Research Institute – Nonprofit organization researching AI safety\\n\\nNotes\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\n^ The term \"pre-training\" refers to general language training as distinct from fine-tuning for specific tasks.\\n\\n^ One petaflop/s-day is approximately equal to 1020 neural net operations.[188]\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\n^ a b \"OpenAI, Inc\".

OpenAI. June 11, 2020. Archived from the original on June 11, 2020. Retrieved June 14, 2020. Why did OpenAI choose to release an API instead of open-sourcing the models? There are three main reasons we did this. First, commercializing the technology helps us pay for our ongoing AI research, safety, and policy efforts. Second, many of the models underlying the API are very large, taking a lot of expertise to develop and deploy and making them very expensive to run. This makes it hard for anyone except larger companies to benefit from the underlying technology. We\\'re hopeful that the API will make powerful AI systems more accessible to smaller businesses and organizations. Third, the API model allows us to more easily respond to misuse of the technology. Since it is hard to predict the downstream use cases of our models, it feels inherently safer to release them via an API and broaden access over time, rather than release an open source model where access cannot be adjusted if it turns out to have harmful applications.\\n\\n^ Coldewey, Devin (June 11, 2020). \"OpenAI makes an all-purpose API for its text-based AI capabilities\".

Nvidia is also a leading supplier of artificial intelligence (AI) hardware and software.[6][7] Nvidia outsources the manufacturing of the hardware it designs.\\nNvidia\\'s professional line of GPUs are used for edge-to-cloud computing and in supercomputers and workstations for applications in fields such as architecture, engineering and construction, media and entertainment, automotive, scientific research, and manufacturing design.[8] Its GeForce line of GPUs are aimed at the consumer market and are used in applications such as video editing, 3D rendering, and PC gaming. With a market share of 80.2% in the second quarter of 2023,[9] Nvidia leads global sales of discrete desktop GPUs by a wide margin. The company expanded its presence in the gaming industry with the introduction of the Shield Portable (a handheld game console), Shield Tablet (a gaming tablet), and Shield TV (a digital media player), as well as its cloud gaming service GeForce Now.[10]\\nIn addition to GPU design and outsourcing manufacturing, Nvidia provides the CUDA software platform and API that allows the creation of massively parallel programs which utilize GPUs.[11][12] They are deployed in supercomputing sites around the world.[13][14] In the late 2000s, Nvidia had moved into the mobile computing market, where it produced Tegra mobile processors for smartphones and tablets and vehicle navigation and entertainment systems.[15][16][17] Its competitors include AMD, Intel,[18] Qualcomm,[19] and AI accelerator companies such as Cerebras and Graphcore. It also makes AI-powered software for audio and video processing (e.g., Nvidia Maxine).[20]\\nNvidia\\'s attempt to acquire Arm from SoftBank in September 2020 failed to materialize following extended regulatory scrutiny, leading to the termination of the deal in February 2022 in what would have been the largest semiconductor acquisition.[21][22] In 2023, Nvidia became the seventh public U.S. company to be valued at over $1 trillion,[23] and the company\\'s valuation has increased rapidly since then amid growing demand for data center chips with AI capabilities in the midst of the AI boom.[24][25] In June 2024, for one day, Nvidia overtook Microsoft as the world\\'s most valuable publicly traded company, with a market capitalization of over $3.3 trillion.[26]\\nHistory\\n[edit]\\nFounding\\n[edit]')"

              "Document(metadata={'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia'}, page_content='History\\n[edit]\\nFounding\\n[edit]\\nNvidia was founded on April 5, 1993,[27][28][29] by Jensen Huang (who, as of 2025[update], remains CEO), a Taiwanese-American electrical engineer who was previously the director of CoreWare at LSI Logic and a microprocessor designer at AMD; Chris Malachowsky, an engineer who worked at Sun Microsystems; and Curtis Priem, who was previously a senior staff engineer and graphics chip designer at IBM and Sun Microsystems.[30][31] In late 1992, the three men agreed to start the company in a meeting at a Denny\\'s roadside diner on Berryessa Road in East San Jose.[32][33][34][35]\\nAt the time, Malachowsky and Priem were frustrated with Sun\\'s management and were looking to leave, but Huang was on \"firmer ground\",[36] in that he was already running his own division at LSI.[33] The three co-founders discussed a vision of the future which was so compelling that Huang decided to leave LSI[36] and become the chief executive officer of their new startup.[33]\\nThe three co-founders envisioned graphics-based processing as the best trajectory for tackling challenges that had eluded general-purpose computing methods.[36] As Huang later explained: \"We also observed that video games were simultaneously one of the most computationally challenging problems and would have incredibly high sales volume. Those two conditions don\\'t happen very often. Video games was our killer app — a flywheel to reach large markets funding huge R&D to solve massive computational problems.\"[36]\\nThe first problem was who would quit first. Huang\\'s wife, Lori, did not want him to resign from LSI unless Malachowsky resigned from Sun at the same time, and Malachowsky\\'s wife, Melody, felt the same way about Huang.[37] Priem broke that deadlock by resigning first from Sun, effective December 31, 1992.[37] According to Priem, this put pressure on Huang and Malachowsky to not leave him to \"flail alone\", so they gave notice too.[38] Huang left LSI and \"officially joined Priem on February 17\", which was also Huang\\'s 30th birthday, while Malachowsky left Sun in early March.[38] In early 1993, the three founders began working together on their new startup in Priem\\'s townhouse in Fremont, California.[39]\\nWith $40,000 in the bank, the company was born.[36] The company subsequently received $20 million of venture capital funding from Sequoia Capital, Sutter Hill Ventures and others.[40]\\nDuring the late 1990s, Nvidia was one of 70 startup companies pursuing the idea that graphics acceleration for video games was the path to the future.[32] Only two survived: Nvidia and ATI Technologies, the latter of which merged into AMD.[32]\\nNvidia initially had no name.[41] Priem\\'s first idea was \"Primal Graphics\", a syllabic abbreviation of two of the founders\\' last names, but that left out Huang.[41] They soon discovered it was impossible to create a workable name with syllables from all three founders\\' names, after considering \"Huaprimal\", \"Prihuamal\", \"Malluapri\", etc.[41] The next idea came from Priem\\'s idea for the name of Nvidia\\'s first product.[41] Priem originally wanted to call it the \"GXNV\", as in the \"next version\" of the GX graphics chips which he had worked on at Sun.[39] Then Huang told Priem to \"drop the GX\", resulting in the name \"NV\".[39] Priem made a list of words with the letters \"NV\" in them.[41] At one point, Malachowsky and Priem wanted to call the company NVision, but that name was already taken by a manufacturer of toilet paper.[33] Both Priem[41] and Huang have taken credit for coming up with the name Nvidia,[33] from \"invidia\", the Latin word for \"envy\".[36]\\nAfter the company outgrew Priem\\'s townhouse, its original headquarters office was in Sunnyvale, California.[36]\\nFirst graphics accelerator\\n[edit]\\nNvidia\\'s first graphics accelerator, the NV1, was designed to process quadrilateral primitives (forward texture mapping), a feature that set it apart from competitors, who preferred triangle primitives.[33] However, when Microsoft introduced the DirectX platform, it chose not to support any other graphics software and announced that its Direct3D API would exclusively support triangles.[33][42] As a result, the NV1 failed to gain traction in the market.[43]\\nNvidia had also entered into a partnership with Sega to supply the graphics chip for the Dreamcast console and worked on the project for about a year. However, Nvidia\\'s technology was already lagging behind competitors. This placed the company in a difficult position: continue working on a chip that was likely doomed to fail or abandon the project, risking financial collapse.[44]')"

There, he befriends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, and discovers he is a wizard, not a muggle. Meanwhile, strange occurrences plague Hogwarts, including the mysterious disappearance of students and the appearance of a cursed object, the Basilisk. Harry uncovers a dark secret: the Chamber of Secrets, a hidden room in the castle, is being opened by a dark wizard, Tom Riddle, who once lived in the school. The curse is unleashed, and Harry must confront the evil forces to save his friends and the school. Through courage and friendship, Harry defeats the ancient magic and restores peace to Hogwarts. The story explores themes of friendship, courage, and the power of love and loyalty. \\n\\nThis summary is concise and captures the key elements of the book. Let me know if you\\'d like a more detailed version! \\n\\n**Word count:** 137 words.\\nOkay, so I need to summarize \"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\" by J.K. Rowling. Let me start by recalling the main points of the book. \\n\\nFirst, the story begins with Harry Potter learning he\\'s a wizard and moving to Hogwarts. He makes friends with Ron and Hermione. Then there are strange events at the school, like students disappearing and a cursed object, the Basilisk. Harry finds out about the Chamber of Secrets, which was opened by a dark wizard named Tom Riddle. The Chamber is a hidden room, and the curse is unleashed. Harry has to face the evil forces to save his friends and the school. He uses his courage and friendship to defeat the magic and restore peace. Themes include friendship, courage, love, and loyalty.\\n\\nWait, the user wants a concise summary. Let me check the original summary I wrote. It mentions Harry leaving his aunt and uncle, meeting Ron and Hermione, the strange occurrences, the Basilisk, the Chamber of Secrets, Tom Riddle, the curse, Harry\\'s confrontation, and the themes. That seems to cover the key points. \\n\\nI should make sure it\\'s concise. Maybe combine some sentences. Also, check if the Basilisk is the cursed object or if there\\'s more to it. The Basilisk is a creature that comes from the Chamber, right'"

Neura Robotics, 1X Technologies and Vention are among the first companies to use the model.[211][212][213]\\nInception Program\\n[edit]\\nNvidia\\'s Inception Program was created to support startups making exceptional advances in the fields of artificial intelligence and data science. Award winners are announced at Nvidia\\'s GTC Conference. In May 2017, the program had 1,300 companies.[214] As of March 2018, there were 2,800 startups in the Inception Program.[215] As of August 2021, the program has surpassed 8,500 members in 90 countries, with cumulative funding of US$60 billion.[216]\\nControversies\\n[edit]\\nMaxwell advertising dispute\\n[edit]\\nMain article: GeForce 900 series § Advertising controversy\\nGTX 970 hardware specifications\\n[edit]\\nIssues with the GeForce GTX 970\\'s specifications were first brought up by users when they found out that the cards, while featuring 4 GB of memory, rarely accessed memory over the 3.5 GB boundary. Further testing and investigation eventually led to Nvidia issuing a statement that the card\\'s initially announced specifications had been altered without notice before the card was made commercially available, and that the card took a performance hit once memory over the 3.5 GB limit were put into use.[217][218][219]\\nThe card\\'s back-end hardware specifications, initially announced as being identical to those of the GeForce GTX 980, differed in the amount of L2 cache (1.75 MB versus 2 MB in the GeForce GTX 980) and the number of ROPs (56 versus 64 in the 980). Additionally, it was revealed that the card was designed to access its memory as a 3.5 GB section, plus a 0.5 GB one, access to the latter being 7 times slower than the first one.[220] The company then went on to promise a specific driver modification to alleviate the performance issues produced by the cutbacks suffered by the card.[221] However, Nvidia later clarified that the promise had been a miscommunication and there would be no specific driver update for the GTX 970.[222] Nvidia claimed that it would assist customers who wanted refunds in obtaining them.[223] On February 26, 2015, Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang went on record in Nvidia\\'s official blog to apologize for the incident.[224] In February 2015 a class-action lawsuit alleging false advertising was filed against Nvidia and Gigabyte Technology in the U.S. District Court for Northern California.[225][226]\\nNvidia revealed that it is able to disable individual units, each containing 256 KB of L2 cache and 8 ROPs, without disabling whole memory controllers.[227] This comes at the cost of dividing the memory bus into high speed and low speed segments that cannot be accessed at the same time unless one segment is reading while the other segment is writing because the L2/ROP unit managing both of the GDDR5 controllers shares the read return channel and the write data bus between the two GDDR5 controllers and itself.[227] This is used in the GeForce GTX 970, which therefore can be described as having 3.5 GB in its high speed segment on a 224-bit bus and 0.5 GB in a low speed segment on a 32-bit bus.[227]\\nOn July 27, 2016, Nvidia agreed to a preliminary settlement of the U.S. class action lawsuit,[225] offering a $30 refund on GTX 970 purchases. The agreed upon refund represents the portion of the cost of the storage and performance capabilities the consumers assumed they were obtaining when they purchased the card.[228]\\nGeForce Partner Program\\n[edit]\\nMain article: GeForce Partner Program\\nThe Nvidia GeForce Partner Program was a marketing program designed to provide partnering companies with benefits such as public relations support, video game bundling, and marketing development funds.[229] The program proved to be controversial, with complaints about it possibly being an anti-competitive practice.[230]\\nFirst announced in a blog post on March 1, 2018,[231] it was canceled on May 4, 2018.[232]\\nHardware Unboxed\\n[edit]\\nOn December 10, 2020, Nvidia told YouTube tech reviewer Steven Walton of Hardware Unboxed that it would no longer supply him with GeForce Founders Edition graphics card review units.[233][234] In a Twitter message, Hardware Unboxed said, \"Nvidia have officially decided to ban us from receiving GeForce Founders Edition GPU review samples.

It might refer to total assistance provided by Nvidia, but the context doesn\\'t mention anything like that. Let me check the given text again.\\n\\nLooking through the context, there\\'s a section about the Inception Program, which supports startups in AI and data science. It mentions cumulative funding of US$60 billion as of August 2021. There\\'s also information about the GeForce Partner Program, but it was canceled in 2018. The text talks about financial figures like revenue and net income for various years, but nothing about \"Total assists.\" \\n\\nThe user might be referring to financial assistance, like grants or funding provided by Nvidia. The Inception Program\\'s cumulative funding is mentioned as $60 billion, but that\\'s from 2021. However, the question is phrased as \"Total assists,\" which isn\\'t directly addressed. There\\'s also mention of the GTX 970 class-action lawsuit settlement offering refunds, but that\\'s a legal settlement, not assistance. \\n\\nSince the context doesn\\'t explicitly mention \"Total assists\" or a specific figure for such assistance, the correct answer would be that the information isn\\'t available in the provided text. I should avoid making up numbers or assumptions. The answer should be that I don\\'t know.\\nOkay, I need to answer the question \"How much nvidia Total assists\" based on the given context.

A total of $1 billion in capital was pledged by Sam Altman, Greg Brockman, Elon Musk, Reid Hoffman, Jessica Livingston, Peter Thiel, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Infosys, and YC Research.[16][17] The actual collected total amount of contributions was only $130 million until 2019.[10] According to an investigation led by TechCrunch, while YC Research never contributed any funds, Open Philanthropy contributed $30 million and another $15 million in verifiable donations were traced back to Musk.[18] OpenAI later stated that Musk\\'s contributions totaled less than $45 million.[19] The organization stated it would \"freely collaborate\" with other institutions and researchers by making its patents and research open to the public.[20][21] OpenAI was initially run from Brockman\\'s living room.[22] It was later headquartered at the Pioneer Building in the Mission District, San Francisco.[23][24]\\nAccording to OpenAI\\'s charter, its founding mission is \"to ensure that artificial general intelligence (AGI)—by which we mean highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work—benefits all of humanity.\"[6]\\nAccording to Wired, Brockman met with Yoshua Bengio, one of the \"founding fathers\" of deep learning, and drew up a list of the \"best researchers in the field\".[25] Brockman was able to hire nine of them as the first employees in December 2015.[25] In 2016, OpenAI paid corporate-level (rather than nonprofit-level) salaries, but did not pay AI researchers salaries comparable to those of Facebook or Google.[25]\\nMicrosoft\\'s Peter Lee stated that the cost of a top AI researcher exceeds the cost of a top NFL quarterback prospect.[25] OpenAI\\'s potential and mission drew these researchers to the firm; a Google employee said he was willing to leave Google for OpenAI \"partly because of the very strong group of people and, to a very large extent, because of its mission.\"[25] Brockman stated that \"the best thing that I could imagine doing was moving humanity closer to building real AI in a safe way.\"[25] OpenAI co-founder Wojciech Zaremba stated that he turned down \"borderline crazy\" offers of two to three times his market value to join OpenAI instead.[25]\\nIn April 2016, OpenAI released a public beta of \"OpenAI Gym\", its platform for reinforcement learning research.[26] Nvidia gifted its first DGX-1 supercomputer to OpenAI in August 2016 to help it train larger and more complex AI models with the capability of reducing processing time from six days to two hours.[27][28] In December 2016, OpenAI released \"Universe\", a software platform for measuring and training an AI\\'s general intelligence across the world\\'s supply of games, websites, and other applications.[29][30][31][32]\\nIn 2017, OpenAI spent $7.9 million, or a quarter of its functional expenses, on cloud computing alone.[33] In comparison, DeepMind\\'s total expenses in 2017 were $442 million. In the summer of 2018, simply training OpenAI\\'s Dota 2 bots required renting 128,000 CPUs and 256 GPUs from Google for multiple weeks.\\nIn 2018, Musk resigned from his Board of Directors seat, citing \"a potential future conflict [of interest]\" with his role as CEO of Tesla due to Tesla\\'s AI development for self-driving cars.[34] Sam Altman claims that Musk believed that OpenAI had fallen behind other players like Google and Musk proposed instead to take over OpenAI himself, which the board rejected. Musk subsequently left OpenAI.\\nIn February 2019, GPT-2 was announced, which gained attention for its ability to generate human-like text.[35]\\n2019: Transition from non-profit\\n[edit]\\nIn 2019, OpenAI transitioned from non-profit to \"capped\" for-profit, with the profit being capped at 100 times any investment.[36] According to OpenAI, the capped-profit model allows OpenAI Global, LLC to legally attract investment from venture funds and, in addition, to grant employees stakes in the company.[37] Many top researchers work for Google Brain, DeepMind, or Facebook, which offer stock options that a nonprofit would be unable to.[38] Before the transition, public disclosure of the compensation of top employees at OpenAI was legally required.[39]\\nThe company then distributed equity to its employees and partnered with Microsoft,[40] announcing an investment package of $1 billion into the company. Since then, OpenAI systems have run on an Azure-based supercomputing platform from Microsoft.[41][42][43]\\n\\nOn November 20, 2023, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella announced Altman and Brockman would be joining Microsoft to lead a new advanced AI research team, but added that they were still committed to OpenAI despite recent events.[283] Before the partnership with Microsoft was finalized, Altman gave the board another opportunity to negotiate with him.[284] About 738 of OpenAI\\'s 770 employees, including Murati and Sutskever, signed an open letter stating they would quit their jobs and join Microsoft if the board did not rehire Altman and then resign.[285][286] This prompted OpenAI investors to consider legal action against the board as well.[287] In response, OpenAI management sent an internal memo to employees stating that negotiations with Altman and the board had resumed and would take some time.[288]\\nOn November 21, 2023, after continued negotiations, Altman and Brockman returned to the company in their prior roles along with a reconstructed board made up of new members Bret Taylor (as chairman) and Lawrence Summers, with D\\'Angelo remaining.[289] On November 22, 2023, emerging reports suggested that Sam Altman\\'s dismissal from OpenAI may have been linked to his alleged mishandling of a significant breakthrough in the organization\\'s secretive project codenamed Q*. According to sources within OpenAI, Q* is aimed at developing AI capabilities in logical and mathematical reasoning, and reportedly involves performing math on the level of grade-school students.[290][291][292] Concerns about Altman\\'s response to this development, specifically regarding the discovery\\'s potential safety implications, were reportedly raised with the company\\'s board shortly before Altman\\'s firing.[293] On November 29, 2023, OpenAI announced that an anonymous Microsoft employee had joined the board as a non-voting member to observe the company\\'s operations;[294] Microsoft resigned from the board in July 2024.[295]\\nContent moderation contract with Sama\\n[edit]\\nFor broader coverage of this topic, see Content moderation and working conditions.\\nIn January 2023, OpenAI has been criticized for outsourcing the annotation of data sets to Sama, a company based in San Francisco that employed workers in Kenya. These annotations were used to train an AI model to detect toxicity, which could then be used to moderate toxic content, notably from ChatGPT\\'s training data and outputs. However, these pieces of text usually contained detailed descriptions of various types of violence, including sexual violence. The investigation uncovered that OpenAI began sending snippets of data to Sama as early as November 2021. The four Sama employees interviewed by Time described themselves as mentally scarred. OpenAI paid Sama $12.50 per hour of work, and Sama was redistributing the equivalent of between $1.32 and $2.00 per hour post-tax to its annotators. Sama\\'s spokesperson said that the $12.50 was also covering other implicit costs, among which were infrastructure expenses, quality assurance and management.[296]\\nLack of technological transparency\\n[edit]\\nIn March 2023, the company was also criticized for disclosing particularly few technical details about products like GPT-4, contradicting its initial commitment to openness and making it harder for independent researchers to replicate its work and develop safeguards. OpenAI cited competitiveness and safety concerns to justify this strategic turn. OpenAI\\'s former chief scientist Ilya Sutskever argued in 2023 that open-sourcing increasingly capable models was increasingly risky, and that the safety reasons for not open-sourcing the most potent AI models would become \"obvious\" in a few years.[297]\\nNon-disparagement agreement\\n[edit]\\nOn May 17, 2024, a Vox article reported that OpenAI was asking departing employees to sign a lifelong non-disparagement agreement forbidding them from criticizing OpenAI or acknowledging the existence of the agreement. Daniel Kokotajlo, a former employee, publicly stated that he forfeited his vested equity in OpenAI in order to leave without signing the agreement.[298][299] Sam Altman stated that he was unaware of the equity cancellation provision, and that OpenAI never enforced it to cancel any employee\\'s vested equity.[300] Vox published leaked documents and emails challenging this claim.[301] On May 23, 2024, OpenAI sent a memo releasing former employees from the agreement.[302]\\nProposed shift from nonprofit control\\n[edit]\\n\\nQuestion: who are the key employees in OpenAI\\nHelpful Answer: The key employees in OpenAI include Sam Altman, Greg Brockman, Ilya Sutskever, Wojciech Zaremba, and others such as Yura Burda, Harri Edwards, Bowen Baker, Teddy Lee, Jan Leike, John Schulman, Karl Cobbe, and others mentioned in the context. The company also had a number of researchers and engineers involved in its projects.\\n\\nThe key employees in OpenAI include Sam Altman, Greg Brockman, Ilya Sutskever, Wojciech Zaremba, and others such as Yura Burda, Harri Edwards, Bowen Baker, Teddy Lee, Jan Leike, John Schulman, Karl Cobbe, and others mentioned in the context. The company also had a number of researchers and engineers involved in its projects.\\nOkay, let\\'s see. The user is asking about the key employees in OpenAI. I need to look through the provided context to find names of significant employees.\\n\\nFirst, the history section mentions the founding in 2015 with Sam Altman, Elon Musk, Ilya Sutskever, Greg Brockman, and others as co-founders. Sam Altman and Elon Musk were co-chairs. Then, in the 2015-2018 section, it says Brockman was one of the first employees hired in December 2015. Also, Wojciech Zaremba is mentioned as a co-founder who joined OpenAI. \\n\\nIn the 2019 transition section, there\\'s a mention of Ilya Sutskever as the former chief scientist. Other names like Yura Burda, Harri Edwards, Bowen Baker, Teddy Lee, Jan Leike, John Schulman, Karl Cobbe are listed in the context, specifically in the \"Let\\'s Verify Step by Step\" paper. \\n\\nAdditionally, there\\'s a mention of Sarah Friar and Scott Schools as former members of the senior management. Also, in the legal challenges section, Sarah Silverman sued OpenAI, but she\\'s not an employee. \\n\\nThe current key employees would include Sam Altman (though he was ousted, then returned), Greg Brockman, Ilya Sutskever (former chief scientist), and others like Yura Burda, Harri Edwards, etc. Also, the board members like Bret Taylor and Lawrence Summers are mentioned in the 2023 events. \\n\\nWait, the user is asking for key employees, not board members.

            "Helpful Answer: The founder of Meta is Mark Zuckerberg.\n",
            "Okay, so I need to figure out who the founder of Meta is. Let me start by recalling what I know. Meta is the parent company of Facebook, right? And I remember that Mark Zuckerberg is the CEO of Facebook. But the question is about the founder of Meta. \n",
            "\n",
            "Looking at the context provided, there's a section under \"People\" that lists the founders. It says: \"Founders Mark Zuckerberg (28% equity) Dustin Moskovitz (7%) Eduardo Saverin (5%, formerly) Chris Hughes (1%, formerly) Andrew McCollum\". So that seems to list the founders of Meta. Mark Zuckerberg is definitely the main one here, as he's the CEO and has a significant equity stake. The others are co-founders, but the question is asking for the founder, which might refer to the primary founder. \n",
            "\n",
            "I should check if there's any other information that might contradict this. The context also mentions that Meta was formerly known as Facebook, Inc., and the founders are listed there. Additionally, in the section about the company's history, it mentions that Mark Zuckerberg founded Facebook, which later became Meta. \n",
            "\n",
            "So putting this together, the answer should be Mark Zuckerberg. Even though there are other co-founders listed, the question might be looking for the primary founder, which is Zuckerberg. The context doesn't mention any other individual as the sole founder, so I can confidently say Mark Zuckerberg is the answer.\n",
            "Okay, so the user is asking who the founder of Meta is. Let me check the context provided.\n",
            "\n",
            "In the \"People\" section under \"Founders,\" it lists Mark Zuckerberg, Dustin Moskovitz, Eduardo Saverin, and Chris Hughes. Mark Zuckerberg is listed first with 28% equity, which suggests he's the primary founder. The context also mentions that Meta was formerly known as Facebook, Inc., and Zuckerberg is noted as the CEO and a major shareholder. \n",
            "\n",
            "The question is about the founder, and while there are multiple founders, the answer likely expects the primary one. The context doesn't mention any other individual as the sole founder, so Mark Zuckerberg is the correct answer.\n",
